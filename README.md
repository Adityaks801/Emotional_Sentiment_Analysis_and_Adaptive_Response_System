Emotional Sentiment Analysis and Adaptive Response System
Overview
This project implements an Emotional Sentiment Analysis and Adaptive Response System using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system detects emotions in conversational text and generates contextually appropriate, empathetic responses. It leverages the Google AI GoEmotions dataset and a pre-trained model (facebook/bart-large-mnli) for emotion classification, followed by response generation based on the identified emotional state.

Dataset
The Google AI GoEmotions dataset is used for emotion classification. It consists of Reddit comments labeled with emotional tones, designed to train models for deep analysis of text tonality. The dataset contains:

12 Positive Emotions
11 Negative Emotions
4 Ambiguous Emotions
1 Neutral Emotion
This expanded emotional spectrum allows for more sensitive and nuanced models, improving applications like chatbots, behavior detection, and customer support systems.

Features
Emotion Detection: The system detects emotions such as joy, sadness, stress, anxiety, and more using a pre-trained facebook/bart-large-mnli model.
Empathetic Response Generation: Tailored, empathetic responses are generated based on the detected emotions.
Modular Design: The system is designed in a modular way for easy extension and customization.

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Adityaks801/Emotional_Sentiment_Analysis_and_Adaptive_Response_System.git
cd Emotional-Sentiment-Analysis
Install required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Preprocess the data: The dataset will be cleaned and preprocessed. Run the following command:

python data_cleaning.py
Train the model: Once the data is prepared, train the emotion detection model:

python train_model.py
Run the chatbot: To test the system's response generation based on emotions, run the chatbot:

python chatbot.py
Results
The emotion detection model achieved an accuracy of [insert accuracy]% on the GoEmotions dataset. The system effectively classified both positive and negative emotions, with strong performance in detecting emotions like joy, sadness, and stress. However, some challenges were faced with ambiguous emotions, such as confusion and annoyance, which required additional fine-tuning for improved classification.

Discussion
The project demonstrated the effectiveness of using the GoEmotions dataset for creating a more sensitive and nuanced emotion detection system. It showed promising results for applications in:

Customer Support: Providing tailored, emotion-based responses to users.
Mental Health Chatbots: Offering empathetic support for users in distress.
Behavior Detection: Identifying and reacting to emotional cues in online conversations.
Further improvements can be made by enhancing the response generation system to account for cultural and contextual sensitivity in conversations.
