Literally everywhere. There's nothing especially Texan about any of this. I heard all of this in freaking SCONSIN.
"[NAME] and [NAME] may be stronger, but [NAME] just gone mad. She's lost the plot for sure."
Ik I‚Äôm crying rn
"He was cut yesterday, unfortunately"
"Nice, I saw them during the Demo and was pretty impressed "
Funny you ask
Minus the eyebrows I personally think it‚Äôs an attractive look. But the fucking eyebrows ruin it all.
[NAME] is 16 and [NAME] is 19... But she's looks 16 as [NAME] 0.0
J E S U S C H R I S T those eyes
my heart...
"Okay, gotcha. Does your wife have a lot of stress and anxiety from her job, or just in general?"

"Higher ranking officer? Also, I'm curious, do MP have authority in scenarios like this?"
"Wow, kinda lame that if this true, most of us probably don't know about it."
But he was so *hurt* when [NAME] acknowledged that homosexuality is a sin.
"More like the choir isn't here, it's on Instagram"
"Assuming this is true, frankly I'm surprised they were still allowed to have images of the [NAME] in their homes."
I hope you figure out what to do! It is real shit situation and it is awful what he said to you.
Oh I wish that was how everyone thought. Unfortunately it's not.
And look like big tracts of land.
It‚Äôs good dude I had to have it explained to me I‚Äôm just passing on the love

"I apologize, that sincerely was meant for Askreddit. If you look at my history you'll see that's where I always post. My mistake."

The important thing is that you're having fun
"Pressing Q everytime garrosh tries to throw someone helps tho, if u wanna play support, play like one, thanks"
I love [NAME]. He's another great option for 6th man.

Yup. That doesn't contradict what I said- this isn't a derailing conversation that I was starting.
Since she ate other food I would guess it is a way of getting around a digestive disorder or carbs.
Only season 1 of sense 8 is worth watching.
Really not sure how some of these folks clothe and dress themselves each day.
"ah thats my bad, she just finished the blog and im sharing it around, one sec and ill edit it. "

Love is a drug
"Depends who's there. If [NAME] is there, I hope that's where they go. If not, I want a pass rusher."

Direct democracy is a terrible idea. People are morons who's opinions are easily manipulated.
"OK it should be 4 week Med Cert then 3 month Med Certs for Jobseeker Support with Medical Deferral, the Doctor can electronically send the forms thru to WINZ. "
I feel your pain brother. Just had to put down my rescue pup. RIP blaze it for them!
I like how people are downvoting when this is how so many military coups have happened. I challenge those who downvote to prove me wrong
Doesn‚Äôt... doesn‚Äôt it take more time and work forging a signature and lying than just.. delivering the package at the front door?
And most ironic. We created the language but people still don‚Äôt properly understand us as the mutated the damn thing
Aloha!!
That is a very handsome dog.
This is the kind of winning I love. Winning because [NAME] has 25 and [NAME] has 29
Can you explain to me what SW BRT means?
"I agree: most [NAME] are much better than Prophet [NAME], which directly contradicts [RELIGION] doctrine."
"Just because you would laugh, doesn't mean that the guy in the video would."
To be fair the lore is so nonexistent other than on Ubi‚Äôs site you could probably just pretend that‚Äôs the case anyways.

No you wouldn't

Lmao that's a funny coincidence
Was she prepared to throw the gun?
"Yeah, it's pretty funny how incapable most of them are of actual satire and subtlety."
And AI will somehow be magically more disruptive than the industrial revolution. Because... reasons.
"Lol. I'm gonna try this with my wife. As I always have to tell myself: ""Don't 'should' on yourself."""

Our knight in shining armor. I'll miss those high socks

"Hate the taste, switched to a plastic nalgene bottle"
Cheers. Never heard of any of them. Kids will do that to you...
I only read the first sentence then came to comments to confirm that something about the author would be the most upvoted comment.
It's also the only title that doesn't have to be defended. Convenient that.
There is a startling lack of empathy in this thread.
"Sorry, wrong comment train. Just gonna sneak right by ya there."
I would say you‚Äôll be fine just drink water and maybe run/sweat a few times before your drug test!
Just walk ahead of everyone and be the leader
She‚Äôs clearly hanging at least part way into the space. She‚Äôs so dumb

"I think the hulk could do all of that at once, and fold the wrench with his finger tips"

[NAME] is such a pretty lady. I'm jealous of those huge eyes!
Good job ignoring [NAME].

Wow that‚Äôs actually a great idea lmao
"Wow, after the past 2 seasons that seems like it was like 6 years ago."

"I thought that too, just work hard you‚Äôll get there "
"I totally agree with you, I just wish she hadn't tossed his sweater away :("
This is my fianc√© and I hate it
Not necessarily. Simply giving both of them the legal right to choose to *not* be a parent would create equality within the constraints of biology.
Not that I fully disagree but this seems a lot more like a rant that you want people to back you up on rather than a genuine question.
Where was this claim that they were the rightful owners of the fiat currency? I'm guessing that did not hold up in court..
"She probably just said it because it rhymes, sorry Op"
Wait so I shouldn't try to sell my shavers by telling my customers that they aren't good enough and could do better? Damn.

"As much as I would love this kind of support, I had beef with people over EVERYTHING"
"Go your own way, loser. "
I wouldn‚Äôt expect anything less than those deplorable traitorous trumptards.
It was a poor choice of words.
"Still love you [NAME], get well soon :'("
It's actually just the [NAME] they hate. [NAME] is just their current object of scorn

"Third date info, I reckon. Needs to be mentioned early on, but not everyone needs to know"
Making my bold prediction now. [NAME] finishes #1 RB in 1/2 PPR for 2019.
I've found that people who say things like that are the worst at partying
[NAME] is going to be jealous of this photo
Option B for sure. But with more roundabouts plz.

I like them all as long as they are not fake.
"[NAME] passing is worse than usual. It's alright, but god damn is it painful to watch."
"Man, and I thought the princess and the toad was an odd story"
She has naturally chubby cheeks that are set on high cheekbones. I've seen it before and it's not abnormal.
I wouldn't say age would stop it just lessen the affect of it but probably start to notice it around mid to late 30's.
Remindme! 243 days
The savior!
Season 2 just started and as a huge TNG fan I can definitely say the first season is the closest I've ever seen to another season of TNG
Damn straight! My folks only knew when I told them about it!

Is she dead? She looks dead...
"Oh damn, look at that areshole telling the truth. Get him."

"Here in Russia, we do not like when our culture is misrepresented, but we make fun of such misrepresentations."

Peaky blinders. No one else in my life has heard of it or will give it a chance.
"So America and the USSR are the exact same thing to you? Sorry you're so small minded, hope you learn to grow in the future."
"I'd say we are a role sub at best, sorry guys just telling the truth"
When America decides to care that they aren‚Äôt paying one of the military branches. Which will be never.
My coffee burned its way through my nostrils. Thank you!
Could this be both proof that [NAME] exists *and* that he has a sense of humor?
"Oh man, I remember loving that movie. Been a while ssince I've seen it but I remember being pretty enthralled."
"Write...all your memories and everything remember about him. Trust me, 10, 20, 30 years from now you‚Äôll be happy you did. "
A fucking power outage during a hurricane and your car is fucked.
She looks like an early game killer.
"Ooof, I‚Äôm so sorry, that is rough."
Oh ok cool so I don't feel bad at all about it then.
Yeah that was inexcusable
"Haven't played in forever, but [NAME] solo was my jam back in the day. Glad to hear damage tanks are still good"
"Very well, shutting up now!"
The difference between the two to the right is quite massive.
"Finally, one win for the war on drugs!"
"What the fuck? Really? That‚Äôs horrible. That‚Äôs probably illegal. If it isn‚Äôt, it should be."
I'd rather continue throwing money into these foreign sinkholes than use it to mess up the healthcare markets any further.

I'm old enough to remember the last time the Pistons got a stop on defense
So you want [NAME] & [NAME] to be like [NAME]? That would be so nice.
Will provably be downvoted into oblivion but you could have used *people* instead of *monsters* and have the point remain intact. Edit: Probably*
Pro-tip: the Press misleads you about what is wrong in the world.

I would have liked this period to go differently.
This is the one picture that gives me mad inferiority complex.
The best way is killing people that don't know you. Also you could steal some things so the cops think that it was a robbery

So much fake news.
Very true. Apologies if it came off that way.
I'm glad we have a place we can come to when we have doubts. Thank you so much.
I now understand why everybody gets pissed off at these weak ass pump fake fouls.
It's got gray icing. I can't even begin to think how you'd make gray icing
So you gonna Break up? She obviously don't care about you're boundaries.

[NAME] looks like a guy who owns a number of body pillows and anime figures.
Thanks! Edit: hold up a sec. Cowboys?

Nobody has the money to. What a joke
Was a post of a video by someone whose flag was stolen and thrown in the mud.
Wow this team has no clue what to do against this right now. There has to be 15 turnovers already.

"What an ugly shade [NAME] used to dye his hair. Well, I guess it matches the infamous shirt."
"almost every single time i have a friend from out of state visit, they make a comment about how bumpy our roads are"
Correct but Reddit won't admit that as the reason.
Just do it. Straight up ask if he wants to date in clear terms. If he doesn't no reason you can't stay friends.
Gotta keep losing to make sure 5th is our worst case scenario
Well [NAME] just missed...so there‚Äôs that bit of good news
Damn! A 4-pack! That‚Äôs awesome.

I need a woman like this in my life
This is it thank you so much
You replied to a bot that quotes a movie.
My dog died on New Year‚Äôs Day and I wish I could have give her one more treat. She just seized up and died :(
Outraged suburban white moms ranting about stupid things that don‚Äôt matter and making ridiculous comparisons are peak humor
Ive done this to a couple of people. It makes me feel really pleased with myself. Just riding in circles around people.

He‚Äôs still alive so far. [NAME] is going to check on him.
It's ok I still have no idea how to add
Love this! Love you! Thanks for sharing!
We can‚Äôt have that
Hahaha this is great! What episode/season is this?
Sure but its exclusion isn't some big travesty
"Other nations still have gangs/organized crime, but yet guns aren‚Äôt as easily to obtain."
"Well this beats the whole ""[NAME] tried to convince the front office to take [NAME] at 1"" narrative"
I've been watching him rant about it on twitter the past few days. I'm curious what his opinion on the game is outside the minigames.
[NAME] fucking christ. When [NAME] came into the league he was pretty much as skinny as [NAME] is now. And look at the dude now.
"Tell us your story, too, [NAME] :) Sooooo many more details to mine, ooooofffff... i tried to be brief"
"Me, joining in everyone in the room saying it when she appears...."
"[NAME] wore shoes and killed millions. For [NAME] like me, people who wear shoes have become a symbol of hatred and murder."
Maybe that's what the jerseys looked like 7 years ago when that photo of [NAME] was taken.
"What's old is dumb ass ""durr both sides"" arguments that require absolutely zero thought to make."
"Considering that was a very early episode of SU, making tall trans women feel good is awesome :D"
"I mean, I hope so. I bought his jersey, which would be embarrassing if he was out the league in two years."
"Cheers, sololander!"
Nobody should keep any around that is this ass-cracked to oblivion.
And also something against [NAME]. (My definition of [NAME] is just people at the bottom of love distribution)
Samsies! I could have written the feels in this post. It's like the job I never ever wanted and got and now I've tenure
"All good man, I don't get the college football hate I see on here, and I hate the big ten disrespect I see everywhere. "
"Why would Orlando want [NAME] anyways, this deal isn't real"
"Whoops, I'm* dying. But I wish, they make so much money. "
I actually day trade blue chip stocks whenever I get the chance.
"Give this man a hug, he needs it"
Any good reading on [NAME]? I don't really know if I like her or not.
congratulations :o)
Have they nerfed the [NAME] at all since Vegas?
"Dear [NAME], please help [NAME] be less disgusting. Amen."
Hahaha and those pathetic elderly taking computer classes. What worthless trash people XD
Interesting that despite not having absolute views you are absolutely all over here pushing the view it's [NAME] that's the problem
1 goal doesn‚Äôt make up for the point you lost us [NAME]
Its almost as if everyone is too afraid to be politically incorrect to admit that height and race are a factor.
They absolutely dont know what love is.
Right? Go down the street to the next gas station and leave home girl in the car
For sure I live right on the tracks and at least once a month we have an incident
can we stop posting stuff like this? It comes off as desperate *edited for typo*
Hey everybody we got us an optimist here.
I am just like this! Glad to know I‚Äôm not imagining it.
"Well, 1/2 has been done already!"
People label him as hysterical but he‚Äôs probably one of the calmest amongst [NAME] on Twitter IMO.
I never understood the real harm until I started reading about childhood emotional neglect and how much it affected me. It's very common with nParents.
"That's certainly one part of the puzzle, though arguably they are non-noahide as they historically advocated for incest marriage, but maybe it is different now."
I hope we actually dont need to wait like 1 year for this. :(
I‚Äôm actually excited to see how [NAME] turns out.
When I see [NAME] venerate icons it makes you wonder if they have OCD. /s The joke is that [NAME] cross themselves more than others in my experience.
"4-6, 6-4, 3-all, deuce. Could this BE any closer?"
[NAME] face was great the way it was üòî Hard to watch those first episodes of KUwtK seeing how naturally pretty she was.
As a Broncos fan living in KC. GO COLTS!!!
I totally agree with you. Porn is unnatural and creates honorless cuckolds.
Dang... I‚Äôm learning all the secrets!
Fight me coward! I will never ne frego!
"Or, [NAME] is upset we aren't in the playoffs.... You know. He only really cares about winning .."
"Umm, I think you can take it out, [NAME]."
[NAME] in the highest!
You have to leave the house.
Couldn't tell you. Unless i check the news i hardly notice the shutdown
Brig is basically an oppressive DPS at lower tiers. You can steamroll people in brawls if you have any cover.
Yes. Some things are simply not allowed.
What can you expect from guys who think everything based on sex and romance is solely based on a person‚Äôs looks and not at all their personality?
I did that.
"You said it baby, can't wait to see what marvelous wonders the rest of 2019 will bring!"
"Right. Because our modern society is NOT eye for an eye. If it *was* eye for an eye, the cycle would be endless. Thus the saying."
"[NAME] and others claim he was boxed in and had to call it. I think it was a mix of naivety, cockiness and flippancy. "
She looks like she has a broomstick stuck in her butt :( queen deserves better

He‚Äôs not going anywhere
Its hard not to lol
Wow first fight in a while where I don't want either dude to lose.
"Yes, that might be a good thing"

I'm afraid I'll pick something else.

"Man, I would gladly roast this one. Fat rich people must be tasty.."
Like I said please have a great day !
*people‚Äôs ..this is awkward
Do you mind me PMing you for some help w/ dealing with the busy season? Thanks.
When you glossed over [NAME] history to make a cheap shot at a democrat. That type of dishonesty is kind of your trademark
"Holy bait-and-switch, [NAME]. I‚Äôm so sorry, that has to be incredibly stressful to have to be around and deal with."
Honestly I‚Äôd believe it. [NAME] seems stuck in that high school mentality
I love this man.
SOME newborns are ugly. I did think my little sister was ugly af.
I thought my [RELIGION] boarding school was weird but now it seems pretty tame and mild in comparison.
He made no reference to they slogan.
This right here is the kind of father I want to be. Thanks for that.
I honestly think he‚Äôs making fun of you
"I've done it 3-4 times as survivor and never got the trophy. I think I'll try as Killer, will be easier haha."
I love how he is gonna hit that fat dude and the gif ends
This is absolutely perfect
">First of All, Nationalism ‚â† Protectionsim. Excuse me, yes, it is. Capitalists believe in globalism."
Heart breaking* sorry haha
Nope don't you know? Warden is god-like cuz that bash
If [NAME] gets 350M+ from anyone we should be glad we didn't get him.
Good morning have a good night me and lucky you! I gotta wait for mineüòë
I looked this person up. She‚Äôs a real doctor
The Wall was calling... from inside the house!!

Here comes a dildo... Hope it's not a crusty one...
That's what I heard. ü§£ I'm just curious if calling the cops on [NAME] would hurt him or not.
remember what you're fighting for
yes everyone does this!
Its nice but irrelvant. With [NAME] and [NAME] there I only see a no deal exit
Kinda is. But whatever. Complaining on reddit works too. Except it doesn‚Äôt.
Security camera on the floor? Nah.
"Of course I have. It‚Äôs nothing, absolutely nothing like this. Its just a few much bigger pieces that break apart now."
"Luckily I never got sucked into Overwatch, because I know if I had I would definitely have an unhealthy amount of playtime racked up. "

And now you manage a gym on base ..or..?
I think it depends on the combo whether you can block or not. Right? Sometimes blocking works other times not so much.
Dang. A LPT!
I like the way your brain works OP. Always did enjoy bugs bunny humour.
"Still, it‚Äôs legal weed. Sorry, sad [NAME] here.."
"That's a good idea, I'm going to have to make some room! Thank you. "

"Lol, this one‚Äôs great too!"
Kill trading is still bad imo but i agree that losing the round was correct
Yes [NAME] are authoritarian. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre always the ones advocating for bigger government and more government control over everything.

Happy cake day!
"Third date info, I reckon. Needs to be mentioned early on, but not everyone needs to know"

Just watched this last night. Ron u make ma heart melt üò≠
I would love to see [NAME] take on the Avengers and win.
It took me way too long to realize that was a claw and not just a smashy thing.
Agree! Poor girls! They seem so sweet.
This is why I love politics. It really shows how stupid people are.
Good for you
I know you‚Äôre playin but it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if I hear this for real
He really is so beautiful.... on the inside üòä
That‚Äôs awesome!
I came.
someone should of grabbed [NAME] by his foot and use him as a club to bash [NAME]..
I‚ÄôLL SEE YOU AGAIN NEXT TIME
> whatever happened to MK9's revealing style? Female characters started getting treated as actual characters and not just strictly fanservice mannequins.
A good therapist can lead you to talking about what you need to talk about once they get to know you and your emotions and trends
I did that.
"Holy heck I'm so happy for you! That shit is an expense no one needs to worry about, and nor you don't! :D"
You‚Äôre buying a hipster truck then demanding INVOICE PORT PDICE. If they don‚Äôt broom you won‚Äôt get a survey for sure lol
That‚Äôs what we said about 2017 and 2018 after 2016 it only got worse and it‚Äôs not gonna get any better I guarantee
Still as confused as the rest of ya myself.
Wonderfully said!
"If you're going to troll us, at least put a little effort into it. "

I agreed with your comment until you told people they shouldn‚Äôt be parents for not knowing the difference between deodorant and antiperspirant.
"Lmao, you tagged yourself in your own shitpost. Like this sub doesn‚Äôt call out general reposti‚Äôs or something. "
Just carry a 20mm.
You‚Äôll have to take it up with my good friend [NAME]
Why?..... just.. why?
Pretty unlikely as those polls are worthless. Also there is no way GOP/Trump would have supported [NAME] over [NAME] if they thought he was the stronger of the two
It‚Äôs crazy that people know this and yet rake [NAME] over the coals for not wanting to talk to [NAME].
I'm gonna guess other people in the Texans org don't feel he deserves the credit you're giving him.
You'd think people who have this high an opinion of themselves would be more open to taking advice on how to beat certain matchups. Enjoy being a scrub.
That sounds like a good system.
Oh. You‚Äôre one of.... ^*those.*
u the type of guy to still defend [NAME] even after the flashbacks arent ya
And how did that turn out for [NAME]?
Isn‚Äôt SOHR group of people(organisation)? lol dont tell me its just one guy.

"That would set an awful precedent Anytime the president can't pass something legislatively, he can just shut down the government to force his agenda through. "

We should strip [NAME] of his Stoney badge for being so soft.
I agree that you need more time in the later turns. But most games it feels like people wait until it is their turn to start thinking.
"Good thing you listened to your gut, ran, and made a lot of noise! Yikes! Glad you're ok."
No I didn't take it that way. My apologies if my comment appeared to be taking a shot at you.

but what about my insecurities.
blocking [NAME] run ? Very bad
Haha love it!
It is liver toxic but this was given in a hospital. Liver toxicity usually results from taking too much to often.
Is there a sub reddit for targeted memes like this?
This sounds so painful. I am so sorry. This ED is literally a demon.
I cannot believe the fucking audacity of him. Have some shame for [NAME] sake.
You shut your mouth. shut it right now. *sobbing uncontrollably*
"I know. And it's very selfish of me to say, but I just wish it was different people that cared."

"You got me on that one - I did just check and you're right, we didn't actually talk about that particular subject matter. My bad."
For the love of [NAME] do not ever link that again
I'll give you that. Society is generally in a decline. I don't date men so I can't speak to that.
Also known as the song ice cream trucks play. I was wondering why it sounded so familiar!
How can [NAME] be so stupid?

The mouth coming out of the plate is the most unsettling. At least I think that's a mouth.

Finally someone who appreciates human life
Trae making sure the traetors don't make fun of his 3pt%
I like [NAME] but he's biased. If he's planning to becoming a real journalist he needs to leave his bias at home.
Yeah nuance is in desperate need. The world is complex. Simple answers using simple binary thinking may not give us meaningful political discourse.
Also [NAME] was Canadian and Canada = hockey which is likely why you made the mix up.
It‚Äôs starting to sound like this season of The Bachelor.

Also a throwback to when [NAME] bathed.
The medical examiner's office was on-scene at the fire pit from the get-go......so far the investigations looks very different from the TH case.

When you're too stupid to realize they showed off character customization in the trailer...
I don‚Äôt know how to write odds for an event as certain as that.

Poor [NAME] doesn't deserve that!
No thank you.

Reminds me of the blueberry girl from [NAME]
"That was great, especially as your first video."
"I didn't hear anything, somebody sent me this."
I dream of a world where that won't even be an option.

"Most do, some are more reactable than others, like warlord and kensei, some are ridiculous like shinobi or conq or uncharged sb from warden"
"I know that, but they wouldn't comment."
Still pretty embarrasing though :p
Oh my [NAME] I completely didn‚Äôt realise. I‚Äôm so sorry

Is the misspelling on the cake the only thing you see wrong with this post?
>It's not that I care Every reply now is you crying about being downvoted lol

He‚Äôs 30 freaking years old and is scared of managing a bank account. *eyeroll*
That's a great song
I love your username...

Lucky I caught people reacting on twitter. For some reason I thought this game as at 6 PM.

I‚Äôve never stolen anything to do this with an Italian accent.
I love this and him. What a good dude.
FYI this gif is a hit on [NAME] so yeah both sides think this is hilarious!
"This sounds nice, but then with what urgency would Congress have to end a partisan gridlock?"

It's actually remarkable how universally disliked [NAME] is as a commentator in the community but he still commentates at practically every big melee tournament

Kernel Seasons bruh
"There were TWO of those ""catches"" that hit the ground... ugh."
Purposefully hurt people. [NAME]. I don‚Äôt understand why anyone cares.
Typically the speeches come from a functional adult. The Idiot is an unindicted co-conspirator with a visible personality disorder. Feigning normalcy is part of what's wrong.

It's not illegal to be ungrateful. You can't force someone to take care of someone like you're wanting.

Fat dont fail me now!!
This guy seems like a real genius.
Let's be honest here if [NAME] played last night the Canucks win. This defense is a major concern and needs a complete overhaul this offseason.
Plutocrats love Wealthcare.
They're obviously not.

"That's awesome. I never realized it was attributed to [NAME], though."
"As per, they‚Äôre being slammed on social media. Their response and justification of it being from seven years ago is contrary and lame."

It's the same couple of people. The only thing I really dislike about this subreddit is that it swings to the left too hard sometimes.
Plot twist: [NAME] is [NAME] estranged father

That‚Äôs not proof.
"At the very least, I‚Äôm glad he tried something other than the standard blue. And yeah, I think the title is above-average as well. "
I don‚Äôt see the MAGA hat kid working to undermine civil liberty. It‚Äôs at least understandable to react violently to tyrants.
Could this be more .jpeged
Huge goal for [NAME]. Big confidence boost for the mistakes from the start of the season!
I‚ÄôLL SEE YOU AGAIN NEXT TIME

They‚Äôre grossed out that these two are blatantly grinding outside of a bar/club environment.
Ugh. Just legalize it already so this silliness can be put to an end.

I‚Äôd say probably not

So cool! Me and my sissy got the same but on our arms! On twitter!
He said some facts and you accused him for being 50c. From his tone you can't even tell he's a supporter of CPC.

It really is a just lean back and watch things improve on their own situation.
There has been a lot of talk about being so open about it was her problem more than actually doing it. I'd call that defending her actions.

"You're thinking of the mirror universe from Star Trek, not [NAME]. Easy mistake to make, I guess."
Nice story. Which I guess is why it's #3 in the sub right now :)
She shows her face and doesn't hide behind fake names on Reddit .
I remember all the Bolt-on jokes this sub was making when it happened. All the best [NAME]

Woah. This is a whole new fascinating Reddit thing that I never knew about
"""While we've decided not to hire you for this postion mr. [NAME], we have an opening at the ticket window"""
My one regret is not making an account sooner. I lurked for a long time because I felt like I didn't have anything worth saying.
Still not as bad as [NAME] not being able to figure out how to push a god damn button.
"It would probably be horrifying if we tried, when a bug causes an integer overflow and resets our aggression levels. "
Oh you mean a documentary he produced? I watched it and it felt kinda bias imo

The A.I. conundrum. What will the robot drivers choose?

Presidents using these robots will loose all legetimacy. They will become dictators. People should invest in good cameras to document the events and share it everywhere.
Every time [NAME] opens his mouth...he says the same damn thing.
"Just remember we‚Äôre all silly looking, gangly monkey things living on a rock floating through nothing, all trying to be cool. Have fun"

Go to highschool with the guys I went with. You'll get the hang of it in no time..

Thank [NAME].
I'm making small steps to change my life
"Well if you refer back to my original reply to you that should be clear, really. "
I don‚Äôt think [NAME] knocking us out of the copa would change anything. Our team is incredibly lethargic.
I did. He wasn't. Y'all lost. Keep living in the past tho.
That's wild. I was just at the DIA last week.
It‚Äôs a shame really... ruining a perfectly good shirt like that

I hope the final piece is [NAME] face in the background looking at the entire group with utter contempt.
I know a partner of mine wanted to convert so we could get married. But he's an atheist so IDK how he expected that to happen
It‚Äôs the heavy sack. He‚Äôs too clogged up from sitting there too long.
When dunking is your only offensive move you will be efficient. Hope he gets stronger and learns to not be in foul trouble.
This. And Dr. [NAME] told him that he was probably the heaviest person in the entire world at the time.
[NAME] really loves [NAME].
Wonderful sculptures. Love the expression of the Scottish mythology behind them.
Just a reminder in case anyone forgot that UGA got embarrassed by Texas:
Every hit should add more and more screenshake. What a tool.
That son of a gun [NAME] knew that a streaming network was the future. He took a huge risk and now everyone is following suit!
3 weeks or so' away from her kid for some 'alone time'? I feel sorry for that kid.
The school should make a list of sexual assaulters. The boys who engage in this should be shamed publicly.
[NAME] I *swear*
Or an armor set. But I get what you're saying
Who the hell has reddit in anything other than dark mode ??
I forgot about that. üòÇ
"Nah they‚Äôll just show the one we got today, tomorrow on the WD, I have a feeling. "
That looks like an expensive hobby.
She's a freedom hating commie is what she is. Of course the media loves her; she wants to dismantle everything that made America good.
"No point trying to hang on to players who are not committed to the club. If this is true then good luck CHO, all the best. "

READ A BOOK YOU FUCKING CROOK.
Oh hi there stereotypical psycho right-wing tabloid sound bite.

"I see you with Zangetsu, and I like it"

Jokes on you..he's in cahoots with the guy at Oxford...
"Thank you so much! After the *loooooong* talk we had, I feel a lot better about our marriage."
I'm stigmatized against the pretty large group of 20 somethings I have interacted with who make gaming their whole identity. At least no-one calls themselves netflixer
"Both sides have extended offers to end the shutdown since it has started, I think it's disingenuous to act like this is completely one sided. "
There's no excuse for him not reciprocating it's pure laziness. What about a 69?
But it's still....the geographic location of Arizona haha.
I feel like I should cop a bass to fill the void. Drummers seem the hardest to find these days.
Our 2nd unit is as bad as anybody in the NBA
Oh thanks this is really helpful
PowerPoint would be nice
"Pinkwashing a violent, repressive institution isn‚Äôt cool. "
SO and I have our limit at calling eachother nerds :3 pretty lighthearted.
This. Nothing would make me happier than the see the gNats hamstrung for the next decade because they gave a ridiculous contract to a hometown hero.
Honestly- live your life as a person who can love what others hate- because that‚Äôs just a little more joy in your life versus their hate.
terrifying every time.
You didn't watch it to the end.
Congratulations! Your kids are very lucky to have a strong and positive parent :)
Some people are so closed-minded that calling them pea-brained is a compliment. That's an original one-liner inspired by this thread.
[NAME] is staying where he is thank you very much
"I really like him goat and [NAME] on the 4th line. They've been real solid. Absolute beauty of a first goal. Congrats, trevor."
At least you can skip it
It‚Äôs fine. Baby boomers are always angry
I haven‚Äôt made a choice yet. I like them both. But why do people not like Link?
"denying and lying or walking into a minefield what ""nice"" choices @.@"
"This video was uploaded in October 2013, over five years ago now. This just feels like an unnecessarily inflammatory post for karma to me."

A cat at rest will stay at rest until it wishes to engage kill mode.
My best friend missed the play using the restroom too. He thought there was a halftime-like break between the 4th and OT.
Surely a ferry could be more cost effective and fun than that.
"Wish more people shared your thoughts, it will make the world a better place. "
Like taking a life from someone without their consent at all? Just because they cant speak doesnt mean they're giving you the right to kill them.
"Okay, but your other comment didn‚Äôt even make sense. Wasn‚Äôt sure what you were complaining about "
I‚Äôve made the same exact comment before It‚Äôs mind boggling
"No. There's a fair amount of nudity, violence and foul language. "
"They're both made by [NAME], and they're both hilarious."
"It doesn‚Äôt work as well as you‚Äôd think, but thanks either way"
"I remember just feeling sick watching this, [NAME] made me cringe hard, I found [NAME] hilarious and ru looked terrible "
You should‚Äôve just put that in the original comment then
You've violated rule 4. Please adhere to the rules of engagement.
I don‚Äôt know why they bother with it.
But what about terminal pulp space infections that can lead to osteomyelitis of terminal phalanx? The reasoning I read was thrombosis of end artery.
I like to think they put that joke in because of the meme
"I put ""haha"" after everything I say because I'm insecure "
"Because it's scary, and therefore thrilling to face your fear. Also the shrimp are easier to catch at night."
"Because at best, you‚Äôre a racist and an apologist for at least a wanna-be dictator and his supporters "
"I think we found that""Magic Bullet"", they've been talking about. "
"I like the head bounce. He can ask the concussion to hold his beer, it will be strong..."

RAIN was amazing Strange seeing [NAME] and [NAME] looking so much younger

Talking is a free action.
Wait... i was told the revolution happens when a girl rejects all her parents taught her and gives her boyfriend her love....
I just want someone who listens to scientists. That's too much to ask though.
Well it does appear to be a gold/bronze Cadillac. And I think I see a flat bill in the front seat.
Feeling the hatred towards that person I get. Actually running them off the road and holding them at gunpoint? No way. No way to justify that.

"Maybe they are just horrible people, and because you aren't like them they don't like you. "
He looks like a genuinely nice guy. He doesn‚Äôt look fat and greasy
The thought of him having to schedule me in really turns me off and makes me sad. Has the reduced gaming time helped with intimacy in any way?
*I hate laughing!*
"I'm curious who those four are? You can't count [NAME], because he never ""endorsed"" him."
To laugh at the bad memes
"She doesn‚Äôt have to be added to the game for her to be significant, [NAME] was just an extreme example."
"I think he means he had an ""a ha"" moment."
I just heal and when we start to do bad day its my fault taking blame off of our flanks and frontlines

"First thing I thought of, people need to know these things"
It was 90 degrees
I like him
I'm sure he immensely appreciates the gesture.
We had fantastic spacing that possession. Clearing all the defenders to the left side of the court so that [NAME] had a completely open lane to the basket.
"He posts on The_Donald, you're arguing with a brick wall"
There are videos of him blending the two songs together too....
"Cool, but what's your point? You gave some context without really saying what you think."
the future is now old man
So everyone‚Äôs cool with the corn rolling on the floor then? alright cool.
"I really love that game. It's so chill, I played it a lot. "

"The angle makes it look like he's 15 feet tall, but otherwise, very good."
Only an idiot would visit places like China or NK. Arbitrary abductions and detentions against foreigners have happened for a long time now.
WHEW that was quite a stretch lad. Gotta do some deep breathing to stretch that far.
Are those potatoes on the bottom right...?
Guess we know where they got the rivet for the fire pit now.
"On [NAME], the allegations and the final result were very different. If I recall most of the complaints substance was rejected or disproven."
Dive is boring to watch too after awhile... everything that's repetitive is boring to watch.
Why did I get a boner reading this? That Magnesium supplement is doing its job methinks

Really should be twenty three year olds.
It's just nonsense. Any truly responsible gun owner respects life more than being tough.

"I don't think there's any ""most women"" on this. For me, it took well over a year after my marriage broke up."
"Honestly thought they were the same thing, thanks for the correction and the expansion of my terrible vocabulary."

Your husband sounds both smart and kind. Good for you. (says she with a big smile)
[NAME] why did they have to remove the OP? Her story is heartbreaking and she appears to only want some sort of comfort from the sub.
Where did I say that happened? Lmao most of my friends are single for the record. Quit jumping to conclusions.
‚ÄúYou okay? I‚Äôll call 9-1-1 for you guys.‚Äù -guy in the van that was running
I always thought of the sound of lakes freezing on cold nights. It's pretty surreal in itself.
"Woah, woah, woah. You're trying to tell me that elites have a stranglehold in a country with an *actual* aristocracy?! "
Yeah but vanilla ice cream has a Super Bowl ring and regular trips to the playoffs.
That's without the Observant feat as well which knocks an extra 5 on it

Shes 43 with 4 kids. That's so far past the wall it's not funny.
Ambien your posts are delightful and I have such a hard core internet stranger crush on you.
I refuse to believe any of this is real. I'm sure his agent will issue a statement that his Twitter and Instagram are compromised
Kids are like pets. They just sit by a locked door and howl.
"My god, [NAME]!"
It doesn't *meet* any moral or ethical standpoint.

"Sorry for bringing up so many problems without any solutions, and sorry for just being whiny overall. Thanks for the time you've spent talking with me"
Do you need a safe space? Maybe a cold drink? Being easily offended doesn‚Äôt make you right.

[NAME] will get booed at home after a golden sombrero in May while hitting .230 and [NAME] and [NAME] putting up big numbers elsewhere.

She tweeted that the most recent episode was very soon after her second surgery and she was still swollen from it
She should just go straight to therapy.
When she asks how he lost his arm she is looking up to him
I deleted my facebook completly
Makes us wonder what its going to be like for my children's generation..
[NAME] revealed that's what [NAME] called it at a reunion. [NAME] was backstage with steam coming out his ears üòÇ
Fuckkkk those are 2009 prices. I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre out east!
Just wait until we sign [NAME] this off-season! Best front in the league.

"Well tickle me pink. Thanks for following up, I enjoyed the read."
"Nah, I got married in Texas about 20 minutes after I got engaged. "

"Is pleading the 5th even legal? I mean, people should be forced to defend themselves even from erroneous claims."
We do? Strong disagree.
In the USA you won‚Äôt disappear for badmouthing the USA. That‚Äôs what I love about it.
But didn‚Äôt they speed up blocks so the net difference was essentially zero?
"Thank you, I'll try my best. At least i'm not binging while i'm here."
I'm not sure how is this as big an issue as you put it up to be.
I think it means it‚Äôll be revenue neutral until then not that it won‚Äôt open until then.
"I saw that, and read it *immediately* in his voice."
That's sad. I'm 16 and where I am there are loads of athiests my age. It's great.
Looks like they couldn‚Äôt figure out how to keep the handle on
"Yeah, he knows about my mental health and how bad it cam get, we've tried all the things that have worked in the past "
[NAME] was so much cuter then. Also WOW that interview is cringy
The world needs a lil crazy

Oh that's right they just came back from the vacation. This is a vacation business trip. What a fuckin' joke.
"Which part of what I wrote sounds like a baseless claim? Could you clarify me, please?"
I like how the [NAME] stood there like what the fuck and then just accepted his death.
"No. I'm against the idea that one can ""liberate"" farm animals in the same way we can liberate human societies."
No point in getting rid of Keemun for another Keemun.
Am i the only one wondering about the white scrolly bar at the top of this post that has the intro to the story?
"Good to see this getting traction again. It really exposes [NAME] to be a useful idiot, and his supporters to be even dumber than that."
"Tough times don't last tough people do... Die'n is easy, living isn't, make the best of it"
"Better yet, get rid of them if they are non-essential. Why are my tax dollars paying for worthless jobs?"
> its exactly the opposite of what I do to get a girl in the mood This is super creepy
I sure hope so. I wanna cry tears of joy knowing [NAME] and [NAME] rode off into the sunset with one last ring.
Yeah I've noticed that. I probably give off Aspie traits to NTs but Aspie like traits bug me
"We need an update, man. What's this ""Outside"" like???"
"If there was Romanian news being covered, I'd want to hear from a Romanian reporter... this is the worst take I've ever heard."

"Vanity is a sin, [NAME] wants us to hate our bodies"

"Bro, too close to home. Thing is I wish I could just chill where this monk is at, with a lot of open space."
We got nowhere with that because you only drop one-liners and refuse to actually engage.

Just a heads up that‚Äôs not what neoliberalism is.
"If that's ice cream, then honestly I eat ice cream from a cup at home. It's great for portion control."
>a Thursday night rampage that killed the 22-year-old officer and shot up a surrounding downtown neighborhood. Not exactly a constitutional standoff with the government
Damnit. Have a big trip planned for the first week of February. Can't wait to get to the airport 5 hours early.
[NAME] is an unrestricted free agent as well
The funny part about it our club has the hide to tell us eels fans that it was the game of the year. ü§£

"You're a normie in loner's clothing. If you think that most of us haven't tried all of the above already, you're sorely mistaken."
Exactly. So many people live here because they love public transit. It is an ammenity. NJ is not trying to make a profit from the PATH.
"Thank you man whoever you are, this has really helped me. Best of luck to you too"
Ain‚Äôt that the truth. August is Hell!!
Hello fellow Nashville Lions Fan!!!
"Sorry I've already peaked male. I don't peak twice. But good try. I r8 8/8, m8."
Isn't that what most of the old people forced to rot in assisted living facilities want?
Like really when did it become about good or bad sex I thought we were taking about one sided
One wonders just how awful [NAME] and [NAME] have to be before people will believe it.
Ha ha good one
What a good pupper
[NAME] having a horrible night
Since they only do 6 a year now I would rather it be somone more exciting and surprising
It‚Äôs legal in TX but with restrictions. Traffic has to be moving slower than 15mph and the rider cannot exceed 30mph

I know he comes with a lot of baggage but i‚Äôd probably go with [NAME]. Just look what he did for [NAME].
Lol too funny
Wow. You should actually delete your account.
[NAME] you are a freak...
He ruined himself. Period. You owe him nothing.
He looks like he's 10 years old...
They got cockroaches . Seen it
Omg I can't stop giggling lol!
> I don‚Äôt understand the boot-licking mentality Calling it in 5 years. That's your future AP.

Because then if the wife gets pregnant it becomes difficult to find out which husband she is pregnant with
"My thoughts exactly, now im laughing at the people responding to the headline"
Looks like Plastique stans will be our cringey stans of the season.
Push me to the edge. All my friends are dead.
Then enjoy your shutdown!
>who accused him and [NAME] of raping her then did a porno where she fucked both of them AND [NAME]? She did?
Then you‚Äôre opposed to the running game. His [NAME] largely suffered because [NAME] got the juicy carries.
Chipotleee! [NAME] Damitt! Closes in 39 Seconds.. but we made it!! Loved this guy!!
"All the smut at Target makes me cringe. That, and the very clearly politically-charged children's books."
"I go to the same hairdresser as [NAME], and she told me we were interested. Dunno how she got her info though."
Except [NAME] had his brains blown out by a .50 cal bullet at point blank range.
Wow I forgot we were competing with Sevilla for 3rd place. That makes this win even more important then!
I keep forgetting she won! Just goes Bob Alaska Aquaria for me until I‚Äôm reminded!
"Hillbilly is preeetty badly deformed, and he's got a secret brother in his shoulder, referring to him as ""normal"" just ain't right."

"I have no idea what you're talking about, I'm in the UK we have a different class system !"
Aaaaaand he will be feeling that in the morning
Part of me hopes this is a finely crafted [NAME] character and she‚Äôs actually a comedic genius.
Hopefully we will se [NAME] at least as a sub. We love you [NAME].
^ And another baby bear. Prepping for a new propaganda assault?
Tbf it does look like it clears the net
So much effort for such terrible person!
"Shit, they don‚Äôt go down!? That blows "
No no! I meant it in a positive way. The emotional rollercoaster of the photo album.

Nah. Mine was wrapped around my neck and I am a gun loving medical student.
"Yup. What is interesting is that Newton's third law is not applicable to SJWs... they arose out of a self-hating, anti-free speech vacuum."

Aquaria looks great but her eyebrows look like gummy worms lmao

Then let's leave society and start a better one.
"Im having a lot of fun, please continue the show"
Yeah imagine if he had been as efficient as the beginning of the season. We would have at least 2 more.
Your market sucks
liberals are filthy animals
Because they pay into the EU we can't threaten to cut their allowance...
The other ending in the therapists office was the best in my opinion. Very White Bear-ish
"That guy is an actor. Forgot his name but he's in imdb, played small roles. "
"Don't be, this is funny. I love it when [NAME] shows his emotions."
"Living with her, he just might be!"
[NAME] looks so fed up with this game. He's going to scream at the whole team after the game.
">You can't purge dissenting opinions over there like you do here. Yes, because top minds definitely doesn't purge dissenting opinions. "
Great hand eye coordination and speed. Reads the plays in the D zone very well.
Oh hi bot
"Arguably they do, otherwise they wouldn't be out protesting for support?"
I still trust him. I don‚Äôt think old school republicans as stupid enough to break the law for [NAME]. Hence they keep getting fired.
"[NAME], that is so horrible. I‚Äôm so sorry for you and OP."
"Yeah, no"
"Wait, so you uploaded a post in which you did something nice. That's a bit narcissistic. "
No. You have to have killed her due to negligence or the like. Manslaughter is essentially the crime of accidentally killing someone because you did something careless.
He‚Äôs from Long Island

I‚Äôm hoping so. I either make peace with it or I decide to move on
I can‚Äôt even get high anymore cause ‚Äúalcoholism/addiction‚Äù .... At least I have cookies I guess.
I don't see anything about harassment in that statement. Weird.
Poor [NAME]. One of the great men of our time getting destroyed by the courts. I hear he has to file for bankruptcy.
The whole thing is poetry. That finish is magic. Nose to the mit. Love this !
"No, it is full of sexually repressed, nice guy idiots like you"
"Haha, just like teaching."
Haven‚Äôt watched much of his other stuff but I loved his debunking of [NAME].
Because killing people is wrong?
Goddamn right!
We absolutely can't leave the first three rounds without an offensive tackle. Preferably Round 1 or 2
> a central bank that acts as a buffer between monetary policy and implementation. ... what?
" ### A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one "
I second this. 3 months is early to really know someone anyway. She could want kids for all the wrong reasons and you wouldn't even know.
Nah. I‚Äôll be fine tho.
Just like he couldn‚Äôt call his executive producer [NAME] to ask if [NAME] had met [NAME] in TFA.
"No, the full video shows that the kids surrounded and berated the native elder man "
Thanking people isn't manly.
I believe so. Not 100% but safe to assume since they a USA based company

"Oh, that makes sense, I just mostly think of janitors as employed in the private sector, even in government (independent contracting, etc.)"
I dare you
true that.
So I can‚Äôt do anything about it now?
Who the heck cant
Hard to expect much when he has not been involved in the offense for most of the season.
That's odd. Where I live it all the disapproval has been silent. The loud people are older cougar ladies that are into that kind of thing.
"Wait, this is actually a really interesting point. That could/should play a factor if he‚Äòs a legitimate candidate. "
"Omg thank you for this Lol and the answer is obvious for [NAME], release Malicious Zangief who can teleport SPD and scowls really REALLY hard."
"Looks like your typical blurry picture to me, but I‚Äôm no doctor."
Mate none of these are accurate. I only read these articles as an excuse to get mad at something
I do remember this and wanted nothing more than to kill that guy
"[NAME] wouldn't breathe the same air as an anti vaxxer, don't slander her like this."
I agree because the issues run much deeper. In your opinion what would be the best way to deal with it? Regulation?
Alligator eats the bigger number
"Haha I remember her! And that documentary was insane. (its on Netflix and is called The Rachel Divide, for anyone who is wondering.)"
It's all been downhill since the [NAME] arrived. #NormansGoHome.
"That might be intentional? Not sure, I don't use it."
"Maybe, idk though. I dont think thats enough to nail him. We need more."
[NAME] my friend and if he has new friends I‚Äôm ok with that.
Yeah super confused about that considering it was only [NAME] she had beef with lol
Heaven forbid /s
"I'd say ""[NAME] retire binch"", but I'm a little late for that."
We‚Äòre looking good so far
Can't help but feel that going down 3-0 is nerves and fear of playing someone with [NAME] mythology. AO to [NAME] is like RG to [NAME]
That‚Äôs because you‚Äôre not an elected official. Learn this one simple trick!
Clip clop my dudes!
Yeah that doesn't sound fun at all. I may just stick to the burbs.... Thanks for the reply.

Bit of a clickbait title. He said it's normal for a big club to sack a manager that's lost a lot of points.
"Well duh, he‚Äôs a scientist. So he‚Äôs probably smarter than the average anti vaxxer"
Pretty fucking brutal when your starting front court is 0-10 from the field. Whatever. I figured we would split this back to back anyway. Good game for our big 3.
I dont want to live in this world no more
"Nope. 7th grade, different state."

Love how she actually cross referenced the picture with the POTUS.
But he got to play with future Hall of Fame QB [NAME]!!!
That's probably how she got the infection in the first place...

BUT I STILL HAD ALL THEEEEEESE
Ah gotcha. Thanks.
I'd watch out for the brother. He seems like the type of guy to try to murder you years from now.

You're setting the bar awfully low for yourself.
In that case you're very welcome to call your representative and tell them to agree to a bill which would reopen the government. Or tweet the president.

Personally I think anyone false claiming Jailor and continously claiming it every night while not being mafia deserve idk like a week griefing ban or something.
"Other than family, I neither remember the last time I got a compliment "
A dangerous and oppressive social construct.

Well done OP for acting on your words. I hope you have a great day together!

My father needs to read this! ...I may be wrong tho
PROBABLY BECAUSE HE THINKS YOU‚ÄôRE ANNOYING AND WHAT BETTER WAY TO END A RELATIONSHIP THAN A HILARIOUS FACEBOOK POST
Thanks! Having a look.
"Where do I sign up, then? Haha."
What's the source? I love this.
He looks like [NAME] in Jackass 2 when they glued pubes to his face.
Pop pop!
That's what I'm afraid of but I don't have a lot of free time so it would never work.
When is the battle point for squad spawning back?
BURN IT DOWN

"Finally some good vibes in this sub, im happy for you man!!"
I'm about 5 weeks of NC after a 1 yr relationship. It gets better. Occupy and work on yourself.
Loook all around youuuu. All throughout Nature is evidence of a creator and his love ‚ù§Ô∏èfor us
Your wife's behavior is inconsistent with continuing your marriage to her.
He's only making like 3M more than [NAME] this year wow
"Yup. I feel you. I'm very sorry it happened to you, too."
AND she was pouring gas on it!! /s
Absolutely no one was surprised at her choice to run in 2016...
That's the spirit ü§£ for me it's more about strangers wanting to hug me. But you do you üòé
I am trying they try to say I‚Äôm fake even though I‚Äôm trying it‚Äôs painful to talk to them sometimes
Been sober this entire year. Still not sure what to do with my hands. Might become a cigar guy. Gotta tweak on something ya know?
"This was last year. Didn't go, definitely should have. I'm fine though "
That sounds like a good system.
That canopy looks like it could take someones head off.
Holy shit I was so anxious reading this. I‚Äôm so sorry
Idk if I‚Äôm wrong but I think they gave her some piercings on her ear which are cool too
He didn‚Äôt exactly leave on great terms with the club. It‚Äôs interesting [NAME] is not even brought up anymore regarding psg transfers
"I'd imagine the confusion would be far greater, especially amongst the [RELIGION] community considering there is no aspect of Ramadan that prevents [NAME] from doing exams. "
For you maybe.

"They hit two times - one in the face, second on the coffin."
Get jiggy with it.
Dude don‚Äôt even trip. [NAME] is the shit. I also have a soft spot for [NAME] if you‚Äôre into her at all lol
Or he just tired of her and this cute chick just slid into the DM just in time
No you wouldn't
Going small here... interesting
"Partial reopening within the next two weeks for services to the [NAME], but unfortunately for some a lot of the government is never coming back from this."
"You sound upset. Maybe take a break, kiddo. Everyone knows [NAME] wouldn't answer the bell anyhow. Just proved it."
You have an amazing instinct to protect him. It‚Äôs beautiful
I love when [NAME] plays like this
Get [NAME] streaky ass tf off this team.
Can‚Äôt even tell what‚Äôs happening here. This isn‚Äôt cringe.
Destroyed healthcare you mean? We have to pass it to know what‚Äôs in it. ü§£ what a dumbass.
Many people. We just don't always hear about it but I've done some research on that in the past.
"[NAME] is great, I love [NAME] content as well."

Hell yeah it did!
"Oh they can make numbers up too , good idea. Astroturfing starwars, this is the worst timeline."

"Are any other carriers better? I ask out of ignorance, but I was under the impression they all sucked"
I'm unsure how much more I should invest in this train of thought.
Can‚Äôt die alone if you got yourself
[NAME] punches here are so desperate and have absolutely zero power in them. He was outclassed so badly twice in a row after such a dominant run.
What are you talking about? Anything bad that happened was [NAME] fault - only good things were [NAME] doing!
I bet you get tired of people looking through your post history and using your anti-semitism to dismiss you as utter trash too.
Im sorry I said something negative about your beloved Valve.
Weird combinaison of letters for french poeple

I don‚Äôt even go through a period and I‚Äôm still crippled by random cramps
First impressions don't need more then a day. Not to Mention 10 raids and tons of pvp I'll be fine.

Expect the unexpected [NAME] funding secured.
"Not sure who they went to, but free in my state (Ohio)."
Don‚Äôt worry it will work at some point haha.

I'm a [NAME]. FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED RHINESTONES!!! Edit: hmmmm

Lincoln Riley had no HC experience and only 2 years of P5 OC experience.

Aww thanks :)
I‚Äôm so sorry. You deserve so much better.
Maybe we'll just stop moderating for a while to celebrate TWOW.
"That's some creepy coincidence, then! Maybe I'll find my Donut twin on here one day! üòÆ One can only hope..."

"Personally, I think WebOS was the best until HP beat it to death. I loved my Palm Pre."

I wish people like this would die in massive flaming wrecks
Can't argue with that!
I did watch it and didn‚Äôt see the thing OP mentioned. So I am not sure what I was supposed to gain from watching.
Sheed... Ik but I still envy Horry
"Someone who wants to drink like half a pint of Jim Beam, that's who!"
Epic artist moment
Good job!
But she can shoot someone in the back of the head and be held responsible for it.
I came here to laugh at memes. Not feel feels
"We never knew what friends we had, until we came to Lehningrad"
"Good thing it wasn't entrapment. Entrapment would be tricking him into, or forcing him into breaking the law. Here she's just lying and begging."
my sentiment exactly
I really wish my husband could get his sleeping disorder under control.
What the fuck is that horrifying picture
it looks like American Ninja Warrior but more strength focused instead of agility focused. I'll probably catch an episode or two.
"Uh, she was [NAME] girlfriend. She broke up with him with that text."
The first article on their is talking about the [NAME] documentary...? E - there*. What the hell is my phone doing
She had it saved on her phone because she was too lazy to delete it. Thank goodness.
I've invested 9 goddamn years watching these twits. I'm going down with the ship.
"Sorry, I meant C"
Woah I never thought of that... thank you!I'll say my news resolution is to bake more lol
I like it...but I still wish it was another new grump episode. I know I'm spoiled but I totally miss 2 a days.
"He's saying he did very poorly though. ""LOST ALL but 1 or 2."""

If only. He‚Äôs signing with the red wings 100%.
Not actually cheating if the system is set up that way. Take it up with your Government.
An Asuka reference in fatlogic?! Love it.
Exactly. That's why I'm watching his videos as well. ;)
Nice I am actually going to the game! Awesome I'll get to see him represent.
But the seriousness makes it funnier. YES HELLO 311? SOMEONE IS WRONG ON THE INTERNET.
Lets just say its probably cheaper to just hope a more positive outlook reflects on your out-look.
What if [NAME] shows up? I heard he loves Mexican food.
"Holy heck I'm so happy for you! That shit is an expense no one needs to worry about, and nor you don't! :D"
Ok but what if you hire him into a management position. He makes women feel uncomfortable and a discrimination suit waiting to happen.
Are you ghosting?
Thought [NAME] had a bad game. For such a strong player he didn't get to keep much of the ball when in possession.
I'm 33 and every year I'm more sure I never want children. I am perfectly happy with my husband and our cats. ‚ù§Ô∏è
And what guns you like to use?
You spend most of your time here in the Rangers threads talking about how much you hate the huns. That's pretty weird as well.
"> Still hard Phrasing. O_o Sorry, I couldn't resist."

I appreciate your honesty.
He has a prog rock album.. its horrific
"Dude, your mentally handicapped post history. /I'm ignoring ya it's all good"
Gonna be a much better game than the last one. So glad you guys are coming to carver
Didn't that used to be the Northern Bank building? Never been troubled by pickpockets in Bangor but probably because I looked too poor!
Sometimes I feel like this stuff can‚Äôt be real life.
That seems crazy that you can't hit higher frame rates. I can hit 80fps consistent with a 1080. Something weird is going on here.
I know but it just makes me gag.
Thanks! Edit: hold up a sec. Cowboys?
It's like watching her do it an infinite amount of times with her saying to herself: what am I doing wrong?
Make sure you get that on video for the lawsuit. Hope she‚Äôs ok...
"C'mon, you can do better than that! Just search your heart..."
Imagine thinking you can learn what you need to about parenting from a paper lol
At the time they would have. It became endangered and we had to stop.
Happy birthday to your friend!
Which will happen.
"I have a boobs but a penis, it‚Äôs quite the embarrassment."

"I'm 100% sure you were punched in the face, but this was a good one"

One day I just want to show up to my parents‚Äô with a Starbucks cup or maybe some Taco Bell on a Sunday.
Whoa you are on a big brain level!!
Then go fucking cry you weak minded piece of shit.
"I've never seen anyone do it successfully on a car, but I'll concede that it could definitely be possible."
A hope inspiring article; thanks for posting! Probably best not to read the comments under it though. Neurotypicals are the worst sometimes
Alot of friends and family make that or less. It's pretty crazy.
"Well, at least she broke up first. It would somehow be worse if she kept it hidden and brought him the news later"
Hard agree it‚Äôs sooo creepy. I hope she‚Äôs ok that man had serial killer written all over him.
Not sure....but there's a cream for that.
"Dude, it‚Äôs turn of phrase. "
Woke is realizing the world doesnt revolve around you at its most basic level. Thats dumb?
"Barring an injury, [NAME] will be up by May at the latest. You're not going to sign him for one month."
> I‚Äôm tired of being realistic and open minded. Me too! Now it is all about being selfish and aloof. Not even kidding.
I dont know.. i did message him many times but he didnt reply me.. i am worried about him. I asked his mother about him
This would be completely ludicrous. Turkey can literally just drive tanks over these guys if they want.
"Lucky you, our low is only gonna be 3¬∞"
Yeah I had android and was having difficulties but I was able to get it easily when using my gf's mac. Thanks!
Correct. I just enjoy debating them.

Wow. Instant retirement money...
Your an idiot and trying to justify your ignorance.
I thought that was the [NAME] special
Interesting...ü§î
What does the guy she's cheating with look like compared to you? Be honest and objective.

Oh I haven‚Äôt even found those! That‚Äôs hilarious though.
"The same here. It's hard to be alone, but not as hard as the eggshells and abuse."
Thanks for your insight random person on the internet. Did it make you feel better typing that out lol?
I get it. But I not to that extent. Like it‚Äôs weird to think every one is out at school while you‚Äôre home sick
It's no coincidence that I became generally happier when I realized that once I covered the necessities more stuff didn't bring more happiness.
"I used it for a while. It made me way more sociable and generally happier, optimistic Less anxious and stuck up Until it didnt, so enjoy it while it lasts"

"Well [NAME], you got the wrong guy. I never downvoted you. I hope your day gets better."
"Holy fuck, report this now. The fuck you doing on reddit? "
"Next time try something called Blue Ice or Green Ice. Its the best. Cools the burn, stops the itching, instant relief."
Im definitely gonna check the bushes around the burn where everyone throws their targets from now on. Im not over it i feel bad man.

My First thought too! I get really bad stress knots in my neck and shoulders. I just don‚Äôt dare to ask every Damn day it hurts
I THOUGHT I HAD MY WILL ALREADY COPIED AND FORGOT I HAD THIS IN MY CLIPBOARD
"I have a feeling you're one of those far rightist trump supporters trying to use [NAME]. Your uncaring, almost sociopathic idealogies make me sick."
Upfront. Costs a lot more over the term of the contract though.
Show me one conservative congressman/senator who is actively fighting climate change to break this stereotype
Starting 2019 with a bang......of death.....
"Ha, who cares about them supporters...the most important thing for society is that justice is served and the man jailed! Scream all you want. "

"Er - I have to leave quickly, because things might stay the same!"
Maybe we knew someone was going to sigh and this was all in the works. Just a thought idk. FUCK
Scary that [NAME] ASG effort looked similar to some of his regular season performances.
My love for [NAME] has nothing to do with his Blackpool performance
I have completely lost my voice this period. This has been an insane 11 minutes of play
Discuss and follow a case an onsessibg per the case are different. It's odd. It's the only conviction on earth where we see this.
Sad because you don't get any women?
I always admire a pinch of salt in anything. I can't upvote you enough sir.
That looks like food for a 12 year old.
She just...can't *not* scam. üôÑ
TSM would be cool
I don't know how I feel about this. There's the story going around that [NAME] turned into a diva once he got paid.
my favourite singer ([NAME]) helped write one of the songs so i love it
Everyone knows a Sith would be called [NAME]. What a terrible fan of the franchise that poser is.
Yeah that pass
Omg that was the WORST
"All that interesting information and you get 3 upvotes , feels bad man "

"The [RELIGION] Church has been raping children for decades, that we know about. More likely hundreds of years. Probably since they've existed. "

Same here. It‚Äôs very hard. I really feel for you.

Take some time to ponder why you fancy yourself intelligent when you revel in pedantry and can't even understand such a simple point.
"I was with you until you said ""your truth"". No such thing, mate. This is just mispropaganda in the other direction. "

"finally, a game to watch"
What? [NAME] looks like he‚Äôs hardly trying and completely disinterested.
I guess the trick is not to eliminate susceptibility to 51% but to minimize it extremely.
"Haha, then i am in... :)"

He looks like he was crying already about something and hes reacting to realizing hes on camera crying probably not his proudest moment

"Haha be careful how you bring this up to him, maybe say you read his note, or he might think you‚Äôre out to get him"
"They're currently the opposition party, sadly. "
I was already over the edge with [NAME]. Just showing my disdain for two terrible individuals.

[NAME] is a moron. Why take the ball away from your best player and give arguably the best RB in the nation the chance to run it out.

You're happy something is negatively affecting people as long as it isn't you? [NAME]. You probably support [NAME] too.

Can't decide if that's because we're playing gritty basketball late or getting kinda lucky and an inevitable regression to the mean
These honestly are getting infuriating. The creator of this made this whole thing up yet Facebook old people take it as reality.
I feel you. It's weird that we don't see [NAME] or [NAME] in the promotional stuff though.
Gotta cop the crust

I lowkey love the chicken and waffles from longhorn chicken. It‚Äôs a food truck in west campus.
I really wanted this to be a real sub.
I'm so happy this whole group of lines was poster. It made my day...
"Aww man this sucks, but at least he‚Äôs going to Europe, so I‚Äôm happy for him! Goodbye [NAME]! "
Do you read any of the content on this sub? Lol. Because it contains very specific detailed critiques and concerns that you're conveniently ignoring...
Enjoy the void
LMao what kinda stupid ass rule is that?
I came here to say basically the same thing. Too much talent and positional flexibility to have a standard lineup.
Most of them seem to be joking about the walls.
Heart of darkness
"Except he does literally every game, but not everyone can watch them. "
I scrolled past this and thought this was a title reveal and got so excited. Good GOOD theory though!
I like it when a girl's nails are done. Nothing over the top long but I love french tips. Plus they're great for back scratches.
"My two favorite things, The Office and The Show. combined in one reference. Life is good."
A nice reminder that no one even considered giving acuna for gray
I find Asian men hot and have dated a few - I'm a white woman
And we know how [NAME] ended. [NAME] should run away like now.
Horrible waste of time.
Yeah nice one dude
This fucken essay
"White, yellow, green, purple, red, from worst to best. Ranks go from 20-1, 1 as the best, 20 as the worst."
The last statement just seemed like a bit of a jibe.
"do some blow and spice, it'll be just another day in Florida for Florida man"
Nah. Enjoy your free food
Mine said I was most closely correlated with Gujarat (not a surprise) and Karnataka (which I didn't know at all)
Very disappointed to find out that you can‚Äôt play NCAA football on PS4. Wack.
I like your rant.
If it ever actually comes out
"Yes but the way she does so at the moment, with makeup and bracelets are a bit uncomfortable for her, she says"
Chipotleee! [NAME] Damitt! Closes in 39 Seconds.. but we made it!! Loved this guy!!
"My boss makes 100 but I only make 10, shat four times today so the joke‚Äôs on them."
Those all look like perfectly good cookies or is that the joke
His main goal is attacking KSI's comment section
I kinda love it. Not sure what the theme of the party would be but... its cool.
Just because you stopped to let me cross doesn't mean the other 3 lanes of cars did.
"Damn, sorry to hear that. Hopefully the right gig will come along!"
$20 paywall out $20 'starter pack' in ‚Äî this would be great

"Funk Night @ Marble Bar is Friday, 1/25. Always a good time and only $5 to get in."
lol [NAME] trying to attack someone with their back turned
What a refreshing question and topic of discussion. üëè NOT üôÑ *‚ÄúDiscuss.‚Äù*
The argument [NAME] is making is that expecting women to cook is considered sexist but expecting men to shovel snow is fine. It's about the double standard.
"Bro, pay attention. I know you guys aren't known for that, but this is not a centrist sub. For [NAME] sake read for one"
Your comments have been removed. This is a community for support. Repeat violation will result in a ban. Thank you for understanding.

"yep. Sucks don't it? You can't do anything about it now, and nobody cares. "
It's not like other teams have been spending tons of money in the last couple weeks. Making small moves doesn't mean we can't make big moves.
Nah u mad lol
You can't be serious.
I‚Äôm far to antisocial or have too much contempt for other people to do something like that
Can anyone tell me what happened to [NAME]?

"I am glad that you‚Äôre doing well, it‚Äôs a difficult process but incredibly rewarding, I imagine. Best of luck on your journey! "
I like it that way :) My point is that you‚Äôre an attention seeker like [NAME]
You‚Äôre the coward! I was the second man to walk on the moon. NEIL BEFORE ME.
A person can make mistakes. Doesn't make her a bad lawyer. Her career history speaks for itself.
"You don't look at accidents on the road? Yeah, I don't believe you."

"I meant we as in the group, sorry if that was unclear"

You just need to live your best life. Do the things that make you happy and don't dwell on any of the negatives.
I dont like my rights being restricted on the grounds of race. That is the issue.

I'm 39 and still love being given chocolate.

"That‚Äôs an interesting point, thank you."
You ain't wrong
Not starting it at that temperature is a great way to drain your car of an ability to start. Pick your poison.
Just discovered that my bathroom at work has this spray that you put on the water before you poo and makes it not smell. Absolute game changer
It's great.
They call her she/her now but they've done a lot of weird things leading up to it

He's been great since his first snap as a [NAME]
FUCKING RIGHT COLIN WHITE AND OF COURSE MARK STONE
It's almost like the whole rationalist thing was started by an overconfident person.
And then I got to meet the president. My name is [NAME] and this is my homo story.
I've seen this about 10 times on Reddit in the past hour. Stop.
Kotaku never ceases to amaze me with the horrible decisions they make in posting stories that can ruin people's lives with no confirmation or validity.
idk if you're saying that I'm shitposting or that whataboutism is shitposting. But obviously i'm not nor is calling out whataboutism shitposting.
REBOOT FIREFLY!
Because they aren't different subspecies
There is so much I want to say. Keep [NAME] close. Don't judge others. Work in love. Take love there and bring love back.
Lol I use an apple charger that‚Äôs split in half to charge mine so I think ur fine
You‚Äôre not a loser. You‚Äôre a whole and complete person unto yourself.
I was jumping the same gun but decided to do some googling just in case. Glad I did :)
He‚Äôs your rebound guy. Have fun. But expect little. And certainly don‚Äôt expect it to last.
What a garbage post
I love [NAME]
I would like that.
Yes!!! You cannot expect her to be a good mother at 15.
It's all been downhill since the [NAME] arrived. #NormansGoHome.
How so? Even if she stop talking to him he'll just go talk to someone else.
Very sure they are metal.
Gee...what a guy...

No! Mom said it was MY turn!!!!
No now a days they‚Äôre regularly updated to reflect the current stats and rosters. This commercial would have been great for The Show 17.
Shocking that a fat DnD kid is this self-important. Remarkable.
It looks like someone screwed up.
It‚Äôs interesting that [NAME] is often the only little kid credited with being the one to desegregate schools in New Orleans.

Love pasta. Not a fan of cosmos. I‚Äôll take an aperol spritz though üòç
"I live in So-Cal near the beach, im over it. Its weird planning vacations to go other places when you live in a vacation spot."
Sticking a road in the middle of someone's land just to satisfy your OCD seems pretty cruel.
The god awful CGI is honestly entertainment enough!
"Well, I can't speak for the right; I'm on the left."
That would be more accurate but less impactful/explanatory of the point the creator is trying to make---it's an illustration of the Apex fallacy.

The funny thing is [NAME] would probably be up for it. Let's do it! LoL sAiNtS
I honestly hope you do that
I wanna try it also. I think I had it when I was a kid but it‚Äôs been so long

Beautiful play by [NAME]. Dude gets better every game he plays.

The only thing keeping me warm in this subzero temperature is my fucking hate for [NAME].
"Then he is still able to achieve salvation in [NAME] grace. I will pray for him, and for all your lost souls. [NAME] bless."

Yup if you‚Äôre ahead and just want to spam actives I enjoy it with an upgraded cursed ankh to really hurt healing based teams
I love this sub
[NAME] is Television. Got it. He's too misogynistic to be the Patti Smith Group.
Theres a pretty big Irish population in Edinburgh/ Glasgow as well that'll likely end up contributing to the support.
I hope [NAME] does some more music soon
Lmao good luck tryna convince anyone you‚Äôre not just a brain washed redpiller tryna start shit just for validation :/
So word is we have eyes on [NAME]... I would be pretty amped to see him with a Jet on his shirt.
Centrists compared to which left wing parties in other countries? Compared to the UK you guys are **far**-left.

The only problem is that what you will never hear pf their relationship through sponsorships.

So basically nowhere near the consensus required for a united Ireland. If a no-deal Brexit happens we can see.
This is trying way too hard. Ease up on the carefully sculpted one-liners and I might start to believe this was even partially real.

Moms name is Salad. They call her 'suh-LAD' so she can feel included.
I liked those no-look shots to the face that [NAME] got in on [NAME]
It makes customers uncomfortable because we're calling them on their BS and this is the only way to get them to own up to it.
Of course there are a lot of people who think feminism and diversity are bad.
So weird watching this segment knowing what happened a couple days ago.
I know right. It feels really good when someone acknowledges your existence. I hope more moments like these come for you.
Wow this is getting huge

Sorry I dropped this /s„Éé( „Çú-„Çú„Éé)
Peep show is so damn good
At no point in that ridiculous tantrum did he express a single iota of concern for what his gf wanted. He sounds like a real winner
I'm out of my past issues in many ways; thank you for the concern. What is one without their vices

The article didn‚Äôt use it. OP just did a bad copy paste I think.
It‚Äôs not as self serving maybe. But Democracy is definitely still self serving
"Girl YES. My kindergarten come back Tuesday, and I‚Äôm hoping they remember my name and how to hold a pencil."

SONNY-TATER!!
We‚Äôre not the President...
Yeah I'm a moderator there. I'll let you post anything there because I'm a nice mod.
He really should breathe in and out. It also gets hot down there
"That actually looks super, super cool."
Yes she does! She is beautiful but has taken it much too far with the lip fillers and fake tan
[NAME] isn't likely to get traded. Out of the 4 he's the least likely.
That‚Äôd what you think.
I‚Äôm sooo excited for you!! I‚Äôm not dating right now but I love hearing someone be all verklempt.
Your passion for [NAME] literally put a big smile on my face. Stay wavy!

I don't think that's how shadowy military organizations work [NAME].
Wait wait wait... did [NAME] go 61-27??

Preference isn't racist only if your not untested in them for a false and cruel reason.
He said some facts and you accused him for being 50c. From his tone you can't even tell he's a supporter of CPC.
That was intentional as fuck. I don‚Äôt know how anyone could argue that after that insane contortionist layup over [NAME] last week.
Then a Rav could disagree that Chicken is to be treated as meat? Chicken Parm could be kosher?

There's really no way to know since my lady hormones prevent me from remembering sexual assaulters' identities.
"omg this is so cute, thank you u/Skraxx"
... [NAME] derangement syndrome sufferer spotted. What drivel you crazy lunatics say... The lies and falsehoods along with the out of place fearmongering is getting really annoying...
Because they‚Äôre going to have trouble crossing the *language barrier*.
This seems like a lot of work for so little payoff. The only thing that bothers me about this is that its not very funny.
The weird eyes.
"Yep. This sub is just being overly reactionary, which surprises no one."
30 Rock is the best. I'm currently on my 1st rewatch of The Office and it's still just as good as I remember it.

Sounds like people who are making a career out of being part of the bureaucracy have come across hard times. Shucks.
If [NAME] doesn't drop a [NAME] tribute tonight in his intro I'm going to be hella disappointed.
He was credited in commentaries as the inspiration for Cletus. I always loved the way he just wants that dog.
I don't think so. I think he is courting a secular crowd of young confused secular people searching for meaning in their lives.
"OH NO, PARENTS ARE SUPPORTIVEüò±üò±"
From that angle his face looks like the big built guy from jersey shore.
This card has been awesome so far. Great debut for ESPN.

This thread was actually inspired by one of your comments
"I literally said I turned my media up all the way, kEeP tRyInG."

Tight competition down there. Tanking for the bottom worse is tougher than getting home court advantage.

"Boo for them, we're all yarn fans!"
Too sore to make dinner tonight. Wong's Kitchen it is!
4chan is brigading her video.
Scenes like these are what make me wish I could forget the entire show at will. So I can watch and enjoy them all over again.
Oh shit I didn't even connect those dots!
"[NAME] is also very creative with the puck, I'm mostly liking the new guys so far."
I want one....i dont care who.... Unarmed charecter
Full schedules have been The end for us before but This time I have hope
They‚Äôll find out that I‚Äôm no goat. I‚Äôm the troll that eats the goats under the bridge.
You left out poor shaming
"Depends. My first name for coworkers, middle for friends."
ah Yuk!
I just have never found that area very attractive. Also from what I understand there is a lot of contaminated burial sites around there.
Great work hentaipoon!
Nice catch.
No going back after switching to a safety razor. Even the most expensive blades are 10x+ cheaper than Gillette.
Wait no monkeys? My helper monkey Mojo is very necessary for our family trip to itchy and scratchy land

You guys can‚Äôt stay married. Attraction is the most important thing if you guys actually think about attraction at all.
*NOW* you understand jokes.
"Ooh, that's interesting info actually (*heads to capfriendly to check how many years until [NAME] is a UFA*)"
And what‚Äôs your thoughts on that specific scenario? Now I‚Äôm curious.
I love gold !!
"You can't control if you're nervous or not, but just know that you will absolutely be judged for it. Consciously or subconsciously."
You‚Äôd be surprised what people could find with just a town name and doctor. Just looking out. If you already considered it ignore me.
"Oh don‚Äôt get me started about halo, the glory days"
"Well the last sentence reallt hurts, but still I'll do my best to stay with her and keep her happy. I really love this girl"
For the sake of football and this sub everyone wants [NAME] to win
Thankfully. We have highly responsible gun owners and our gun control is fairly effective. We have way less violence and people generally can still enjoy them.
Good luck with that one
It seems to be his Twitter reactions really. He prob needs to spend less time there
Tell me when you find out how to bowser-wobble
She reminds me if [NAME]. Half haked pictures with vague sayings. Ugh
"Everything is political, bub. "
"Great, about to rewrite my many ToDo lists"
Yikes at that title dude
This is like the timeline from hell.
When you glossed over [NAME] history to make a cheap shot at a democrat. That type of dishonesty is kind of your trademark
This very thing got me diagnosed as ADD. I'm of the drugs now and feeling way much better.
I prefer boyfriend over partner any day lol
Totes! I love walking round and round and round in circles all afternoon and still not finding the store I need.
She is willing to betray her current BF she will be willing to betray you when shes with you. Red flag don't get back with her.
"Ok.... he can *call* it the State of the Union, but that doesn't mean it is."
"You guys are heading toward healing, that's amazing.. Is it possible that you are wishes on true healing "
I can say when I was 16 I never did anything even remotely as hateful as what these kids did. It's really easy.
Do we know what the source of this rumor is other than twitter speculation?
"As a fellow browns fan, unfortunate enough to be born into a browns family and in ohio... Hello sharer of a lifetime of heartbreak."
But instead of dunking on [NAME] they're dunking on [NAME]
This kind of sacrafice should cost at least 100.000.wanting it for free is what shocks me here most.
I love it. :D
Imagine the smell of burning those pages

I ended up with my kneecap dislocated like that back in the 80‚Äôs (it was a tragic hackysack accident). 12/10 would not recommend.
Appreciate you homie
Happy cake day bro... or ma'am. You have to see this to really take it in.
Just read the text of this amendment. I am literally sick to my stomach from reading this. THIS MUST NOT STAND!!

"I saw it when it was at the Mackintosh Church in Glasgow, it‚Äôs pretty impressive. "

Good luck!
"To the rest of the world, I would like to say, ""Sorry."""
[NAME] being the most manipulative person in the house was not something I expected
This guy is desperate to be a victim everyone. We can't fix him.
100% feel for you. I may be exaggerating slightly but still it‚Äôs all these little disadvantages that we get put at because of this ping.
"oh yes, we are."
I'd love to hear a man explain why men do this
I almost didn‚Äôt get that until I heard her voice
"You guys can downvote me all you want, but this sub is every day looking more and more alike r/gameofthrones"
"Normally yes, but then it would be an attractive woman (at least it used to be)."
I second this. 3 months is early to really know someone anyway. She could want kids for all the wrong reasons and you wouldn't even know.

I‚Äôm gonna stand here and watch you smoke every one of those cigarettes! Maybe that‚Äôll teach you a lesson.

[NAME] bless u
But another way.
"Same, also no parking so they need to pull in the busy road outside my house. They must hate me."
You sound like you are closer to being a sexual than most.
"So she spat in the face of [NAME], nature and you by violating your health."
As a Dolphins fan this hurts me
You were inebriated and eating ratshit.
Considering that was an already exploding market this is kind of a big deal I guess.
Found an Instagram account
Hell yeah I got the 420 upvote
I know and that made me sad!
Funny you ask
You're not retarded. It's a natural reaction to a lousy upbringing. Love your username BTW.

"Can confirm, I am restaurant"
Been spot on so far.
So you have your twin 6'9 215 pound forwards playing different positions? Interesting gm'ing. I see why the Hornets are so terrible.
This is probably why you're not in a relationship.
thc concentrations in weed are irrelevant everyone just dabs now anyway
It's also cruel how noone is informed about the execution at all. Relatives are left completely in the dark and likely never find out about their execution.
That's a surprise from this guy.

"Most FBI agents never fire their weapons and spend more time looking at excel sheets, lol"

I‚Äôm shocked at how big that defeat is.
There's more updates further down.
"oops, back in a minute, your round!"
Guess we haven't been very smart up to this point.
I watched the whole thing. I miss that style of cartoon. Simultaneously silly and understated.
Totally fair. I would be sad in your situation. :( I hope you find it. You're not wrong to want those things!

My god i thought he just hit his shins really hard on the pole but than realised what his shoulders did...
and is where it's at!
We‚Äôre honouring good King Billy. That‚Äôs also how we decided which [NAME] brother to buy.

100% rotation of troops.
I like it
"this ain‚Äôt it cheeeifffff. love is love, don‚Äôt matter who‚Äôs on the receiving end"

"Maybe, I'm just saying that there are players with more talent out the gate than him."
"Clamato? I see you Canada. And I like it. By the way, we need Wonderbars here in the US. Thanks"
I love this üòÇ
Love when the run away joke always ends up with someone who isn‚Äôt funny ruining it
It's super annoying. There is a reason I no longer speak to this person.
"Hi, [NAME]!"
No one is getting jailed for cannabis that's the biggest fucking joke I've heard all week
Digital Danites is the name of my [RELIGION] Devo cover band.
It‚Äôs so crazy how [NAME] went from being an elite goaltender to barely an ahl bum in a matter of 2-3 years. I cri
Still not as bad as [NAME] not being able to figure out how to push a god damn button.
Because I was a fan through all of those NFCCG losses...
It's pretty banging too.
The guy at the deli this morning when I went to get ham looked liable to collapse.
"Sorry bb :( I understand that feeling all too well, haha"
I don't care about him at all. üò§üò§üò§
How many hours of maintenance do they really need to do every night? I feel like they just want to cut costs and tell us it's impossible.
Are 3% of [NAME] really vegan?? That‚Äôs fantastic!
"Wasn't implying that, just weird that a South African brand is so popular overseas all things considered."
I actually found mine today! I will give it to my 1 year old
"My nmom always says ""Well, you learned from it!"""
"Yeah, local subs are always like this massive turf war between various astroturf factions. It's kind of bizarre. "
Threats and promotion of violence
"ah, thanks!"

Mad stinky.
Terrorism is the systematic use of violence to achieve a political goal. [NAME] has not used violence.
This kid now: fun yay hahoo This kid as a grownup: I regret everything
"‚ÄúAm I in the frat now, bruh?‚Äù"
This made me sad

i love his face for that split second after he is hit
"Sorry, but [NAME] doesn‚Äôt even compare to [NAME]."

I‚Äôd be damned if she isn‚Äôt the one cleaning up that mess
"Well, actually it is a joke on how mansplainers often start their mansplaining with: ""well, actually""."
There should not be enough nurses against vaccines to hold up the stupid sign.
[NAME] what's your opinion on this?
That isn't normal or healthy. Stop obliging her obsession.

So are you
"Thank you. I feel like I‚Äôve scarred her for life, but I know that‚Äôs probably not the case."
"This post made me smile, cute doggo "
All of this is almost blow for blow identical to the conditioning children in abusive homes go through. Take from that what you will.
how the hell do I post a picture
Typically the speeches come from a functional adult. The Idiot is an unindicted co-conspirator with a visible personality disorder. Feigning normalcy is part of what's wrong.
That is extremely uncomfortable to look at.
Just like an unwritten rule to discuss a perfect game during a perfect game. Interesting
>Even though [NAME] quit live performing after he got diagnosed but ok
I appreciate this. I don't think I've given up on teaching entirely. I will try to survive!
No kidding. That was extremely disappointing.

"[NAME] would be an exciting guy to bring here. I think he'd at some help at RB, especially if [NAME] ain't interested"
Can this be posted on r/BreadTube if the person doesn't pour some kind of fluid on themselves?
He put a comment about [NAME]
Too bad =(
Baby what is you doing.
What in the bipolar hell is going on? Yikes
"Hell yea brother, Charlotsvile car attacker did nothing wrong Lets see how quick they scream hate speech"
Can't wait to bring it to 1
Idk if I‚Äôm wrong but I think they gave her some piercings on her ear which are cool too
You've sparked my interest and made some solid points. I think i'll make some calls and reconsider. Thank you!
Its natural to fear what is unknown. Especially when someone is trying to force you to open a sketchy box while probably grinning the whole time.
A billon more [NAME] saves and I‚Äôll have [NAME]!
"You bet, sweetie ;) But I date girls so don't get too excited <3"
How do you deal with alerts coming up on your phone? I guess you can just turn them off?
The Internet is a weird place.

Wouldn‚Äôt be shocked for a lot of those guys to follow him to TB.
"You love her knowing her limitations, adjusting your expectations, and keeping boundaries firmly set and enforced hard."
"Yes. We actually just talked about it too. Dont know if he took me seriously, but am trying. "
Just for recreational use? Glad you are having a change of mind though
"Im reaching that age where some of my friends getting married, having kids, making 6figures and going to jail..."
Nohomo but i'd come to daddy
"Thanks for saying this eloquently, I'm always a little put off by some of the man hating comments that pop up here occasionally."
What are those baby blue thingies?
"Whaaaat no way, you can‚Äôt play it with other people? "
[NAME] would get jealous easily.

"Skeptical approach, always lol"
Nice strong heavy stream will make it through
Post the shaved [NAME] bro! #1 guard all over!
She's a masochist and gets turned on by how inconvenienced she is
She's a freedom hating commie is what she is. Of course the media loves her; she wants to dismantle everything that made America good.
"This is ok as extra content, but it feels really uncomfortable."
Holy shit that‚Äôs nothing
Well that makes sense.
"You‚Äôre a life saver, wish you a blessed new year "

Lol. I was fan of that show and that line prior to becoming a fan of Arsenal and recently put the 2 together.
"Yeah, so many accidents occur because people don‚Äôt know what to do in the event of loss of tire grip."
I feel so stupid. I‚Äôve never made the connection between [NAME] refusing to play for SD and [NAME]
I feel like this should be a copypasta... It's correct and I want the message to be spread...Can we make this a thing lol
"I'm a firm climate change believer but jeez that was painful to read. Sorry, this is far from bestof"

"Yes, once I even deleted my account because I was so nervous about down votes. Lately,every once in a while I comment encouraging good attitude."
I'd say the guy who was going beat [NAME] face in is the worst character on the show.
That's really interesting! I've seen that happen before too
Yours is the only defensive comment I see. Grow up.
Idiots gonna idiot.
It‚Äôs a shame really... ruining a perfectly good shirt like that

Nah I didn‚Äôt get scammed but my money is sitting in the Dream Market escrow doohickey. Whatever that means! Haha!

People don't have installation and maintenance costs and when they break down you can go outside and find another one really quick.

"yeah, those seem like they'll flop around quite safely... "
Wish the blasters were more like BF1
Can‚Äôt blame him! She kinda looks like [NAME] long lost older sister.
Maybe try online classes or even start with a Udemy class on writing? Would that help?
Same here. I had a lot of swelling but not abnormal pain.

Not sure why [NAME] didn't foul to stop the fast break there
">[NAME] in a confusion night, Um, she kissed him."
Welcome back [NAME]!! You sexy Brazilian SON OF A BITCH
I'm skeptical a single opinion would change. Politics is so polarized anyone who would bother to listen already made up their mind.
Especially if you're looking for the Linux or Mac versions (which exist for a large portion of Steam games).
I wanna say they beat the Rams twice that year.
Oh I see what ya did
except for the implication that white colonialism saved the native population from barbarism
You said that it is a fact that [NAME] is a rapist based on the testimony of 1 person. I merely stated the same argument based on your logic.

Great movie whose marketing did an awful job of preparing people for.
[NAME] does more than [NAME] so I'll have do disagree about that
That FPS is *smooth*
I‚Äôd think it would be well seasoned. Others prefer adding black pepper too.

This makes me feel so much better about the things I‚Äôve done that make me cringe.
It has to include a scene where Polio ruins his childhood. And he learns about raid low-irritant spray. Because that‚Äôs a thing I remember.
Nah. I saw a post on IG this morning and screenshotted it

it's also impolite to talk on the train

Ahh you poop too much
What an abusive piece of crap. Those poor boys won‚Äôt know how to be adults. I hope their father is in their lives.

"I‚Äôm thinking so, since the sides are spiky and somewhat serrated."
I miss him on our pp
Thank you so much! That‚Äôs a helpful list with a great variety!
They leave me out of everything
"Good [NAME], you are right."
I hope there is a special place in Hell for these people.
Get out now. She's playing mental games with you. Play nice but plan your exit. Ask me how I know.
He was born in Scotland so as much as I‚Äôd love him to run it‚Äôs not likely.
Contracts & money in rtts mean absolutely nothing. Just one of the many missed opportunities year after year
We will welcome you with open arms <3
Poor critter D:
I've come to the conclusion that TMoR's Snoo needs to be more orange.
It's perfectly fine
[NAME] I love you but there is a top 15 game on

At least back then we didn't have AIDS.
Now I feel like an idiot calling it a beamer for the 15 years I played baseball.
Yeah but nobody will come to take note of it until Thursday at the earliest
Dark humor is like food. Teenagers love it and prefer quantity over quality.
You‚Äôre the meme this sub jokes about.

"Auch, that's gotta hurt..."
I need like a drawn out visual or something
Been a while since I watched but you gotta go through the mirror and put the bear under the bed. Then you can go with her.
They didn‚Äôt even respond to my email so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs gonna work
I‚Äôm betting his caretaker‚Äôs name is [NAME]
Yet reporters are so Liberal party friendly that they are not putting any difficult questions to [NAME] and dejong and [NAME].
I know that‚Äôs what I was trying to say. Idk y that got lost in translation.
The fix is in.. to convenient.
All I know is everyone is Tuscaloosa considers this season an abysmal failure.

Wendy‚Äôs sauce I hope lol
Listen to yourself. What other things do u want to shove down the throats of others in the name of tolerance and humanity? [NAME].
There's something deeply ironic about spoil tagging this
Again.. lolz.
Curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal!
Oh good one. It‚Äôs insane to think the last three mvps were once on one team
"You must be heartbroken, I‚Äôm so sorry. Can you start seeing a therapist?"
Shameless IG plug:
I only remember her getting flamed by Thooorin yikes
Found the douchebag

"....that's *naivet√©*, break the cycle... ## DONT BE NEGATIVE 3.0"
Can't you tell that [NAME] is a serious threat to apprehend. All that alleged lying makes him a serious threat to others.
Indeed. This episode is for me the best one officially. I'm scared for the finale
I agree. Could go either way.
For anyone stuck at the

Very interesting study.

I was flabbergasted when I saw it.
"Got it! I wasn't aware that it was a slur, and thought that it was just a general term used. Thanks for the info."
Those sound yummy!
Protests that don't disturb the status quo are ignorable.
I sense no awful taste here.
I'm old enough to remember the last time the Pistons got a stop on defense
"Welp, my bad. Searched for ""new year"" and didn't see this so posted."
Stupid [NAME] referencing that stupid seagull/cricket myth

Just from this video I can conclude that Saquon is a better DB than BW Webb is.

The gov puts the DUP and monkeys in the same figures so it's hard to guess
Thanks I'll give it a go. Nothing used for randoms at all? Would it be better for me to find a group to play with?
Hmmm I dont think I listen to only [NAME] if I last checked. These arent INTP playlists they're just playlists I like as an INTP
I legitimately had a hard time believing such terrible people exist until I encountered one for myself!

This is way too far down. Probably the quickest 3 hour movie I‚Äôve ever seen. Totally engrossing.
A little girl recently died because her parents refused to get her medical treatment and insisted [NAME] would heal her.

üòÇ Poor kitty.üíó I can hear that howl and see that face! You betrayed her! üòõ
Sorry. This thing knows whats up!

"That sucks, I hope you find the finances to be able to go back to it someday."
I am so very sorry that you are dealing with all of this
These people think a magic man in the sky watches them masturbate..... not exactly high runners in the critical thinking fields
I will happily convert to [RELIGION] if I can quit my job and have unlimited food. Please tell me how to accomplish this
"Calm down snowflake. Comment stalking from a week ago is really sad, especially when you're whining about something that I'm 100% right on. "

Bundle up and sled! Make a snowman! Take a walk through the wonderland!
No the bubble is love. The bubble is life. With the bubble comes zero expectations and a sweet sixteen appearance. Such is life in South Canada.

I mean I feel like some people lose it more drastically than others.
hm so overall was this video a + or a -? I'm trying to figure out whether or not to publish it lol
There are no helpful ideas like the one you're looking for. There is only one idea... Tell your parents and get authorities involved.
A sad amount of time was spent making this.

They killed [NAME] for being a [NAME] right after this. [NAME] was a notorious anti-Semite.
But why does your horse have a leash on her while eating. Looks sooo uncomfy. Poor bubby!!!

Good timing with the two breweries having just opened up. Gotta check them out when I'm in that neck of the woods again.
Help with what?
"Future generations will look back at this period and realize that this whole ""Western civilization"" thing was the real fantasy "

"Turn off your phone, computer or even the internet. It is scary to do but just for now when the urges hits."
[NAME] and [NAME] together for multiple games composed entirely of 3 on 3? This is a dream come true.
I like how he called his mom asking if she was trying to contact him just so he could tell her what‚Äôs wrong
Just what I needed to hear today! Thanks!
"[NAME], people always forget about him but he has saved Madrid countless times in so many different ways."
Most people don't believe I have aspergers because I look 'normal' everyone else just thinks I'm weird.
[NAME] ignored [NAME] and I loved it
Mmm... chocolate weekends are my favorite.
"Maybe with spelling, but his dad watches SNL every week I betcha."
Good news. Makes me feel BCH is way underpriced and has a huge upside.
Someone should make a religion out of this

Lol same actually

Maybe [NAME] needs to have a Big Mac meal and relax.
I use Lifesum too. I like the look of it more and I haven‚Äôt had any issues with it not working.
I wonder why you're sitting at -2 for that comment. Very strange.
How embarrassing.
Ah I love when I‚Äôm looking at a random thread and find you in the comments. Hey [NAME]!
I've learned that guys are dumb and to not listen to them about women's beauty stuffüôÑ
Bitch subscribed to 1st look at [NAME] shitposts.

Man pre ASG Yankees were absolutely fun to watch. Judge hitting that homerun was awesome
That's what worries me the most - the exposed glans. Is there anything you can recommend so I can prepare myself for underwear etc?
**Takes away membership card* HOW DARE YOU SIR!!!
"My favourite book, the writing is beautiful. Very much a precursor to 1984."
This literally broke my heart
See but it‚Äôs so common an attitude that it didn‚Äôt come off that way
Contacted the hospital I was born at and I‚Äôm getting my birth certificate! Thanks for all the help this was a big step forward
*Chocolate thugs don't mess around* That's interesting though. Something to look forward to when you wake up
Being born in north america is a curse my friend. Oregon (my home) is kind of like Ireland weather wise though I hear.
Yes! I started it off on a lie! And?
Prey actually had portals before Portal. Such an underrated game.
"Haha, maybe at the 55 title party in May "
"If his seat was vacant, would there be a special election in 2020 if it happened soon? Not wishing him dead or whatever."

Bears are empathetic creatures? lol...
"In this view, you claim to wield power over them, and are clearly no anarchist. You are implicitly advocating for hierarchy."
yah [NAME] is well-known knock out artist. What's your favorite KO/TKO of his in the UFC? Oh wait....
Thanks a lot
Maybe he was just really tanned and needs a vacation
Wooow! [NAME] hitting [NAME] with that question! Can‚Äôt wait to see that!
There could have been men going that we‚Äôre not priesthood holders.
"Yo. This is the stuff of nightmares, and that background music really freaks me out."
I did this first try but then the next time I played I was ducking hollering
"Oh man, how about when they played We Will Rock You to seemingly coordinate the ""ref you suck"" cheer. The crowd was awesome last night."
Whew. I'm safe then.
I haven‚Äôt made a choice yet. I like them both. But why do people not like Link?
Something about performing an exorcism from an iPhone just feels off though
they place it neatly in the basket and the ball thanks them for their manners
GUYS WHAT IF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE UPVOTING THE HORNY IMAGES *ARENT* THE SAME PEOPLE AS THE ONES WHO DONT LIKE CAMILLA WHHOOOOOOAAAAA
I ate the PETA idiot who ate a vegan diet and had leftovers of him. He wasn't as tasty as a cow.
I would love it! [NAME] has a history of injuries just like [NAME] used to!!! Do it!!
"I've had 1, 2, and 4 said to me. I'm completely done at this point."
"hahaha, this is great. We need more anarchist jokes."
What an ass. I almost downvoted this out of anger.
"this guy /u/EightRoundsRapid is sending me nude dm's even though he knows i'm underage, what do i do?"

It‚Äôs nice to know that no one cares enough to send me either.
"Thank you very much. I try my best to follow my steps from therapy, but it seems to be my biggest hurdle."
Happy anniversary!! ‚ù§
Ah the ole pelvic buster
"she always acts like the older sister who‚Äôs copping out of babysitting, it‚Äôs ridiculous."
Don't the [NAME] generally accept inerrancy? It was the universal position of the Church Fathers.
">Shouldn‚Äôt the Bible be infallible No. That would be idolatry. Only [NAME] is infallible,"
We are living in a time of lukewarm faith where many will fall away and become deceived.
"yeah, they both suck... i am not a customer of either, and never will be again."
Does anyone know what the BBC actually said? That article doesn't have the e-mail in which they admitted it.
Honestly I think most of that sort of stuff existed between the 1985-2012-ish. Depending on your age most young people would have experienced these.
"love ya bro, i just love how positive you are!"
Super unflattering. [NAME] is not overweight but this ensemble made her appear chunky.
This reminds me of the Percy Jackson series :P they do the same thing at one point when they visit a dam :P
Makes sense as [NAME] was out the last 5 games. The first 8 of the season [NAME] was sacked or pressured on nearly every dropback.
Hey.... that's not the wallet inspector...
Or dry them and press them into a book!
"I think years...I'm not ready and I know it, but I know years"
"Not gonna lie, kinda looks like a unicorn sneezed on waffles"
I feel so guilty that this picture exists. I feel like I need to donate to charity after this.
[NAME] needs to slow things down there.. ffs
"That face screams ""Fucking gods, do I have to do *everything* around here?"""
Oh of course!
Because [NAME] is a man child who can‚Äôt stand up to his mother
Fair enough ;)
I feel the same on [NAME]. She's trying too hard to be hard-hitting etc. Thought she was poor on Thursday.
He‚Äôs always ready
Because most shit right wingers say is so awful that if they said it in a space where they weren't anonymous they would be fucking done
I'm a woman and I lost mine at 26 (was just a later bloomer) This obsession with virginity is odd.
This is so true!! I'm vaping mango right now! Weird... Wish I was a kid.
Because [NAME] want to control you!
"Sorry, yes they do. [NAME] is the worst QB mentioned in that list."
His interviews are so awkward
Well hes asking is it possible and the answer is that it is possible to be honest.
"I think I get this reference, GradeAUnderA?"
And when I went to your moms house she told me about her super awesome witty son.
"I‚Äôve gone through it before, and it sucks. I‚Äôm still a little hazy and withdrawn."
"I didn't know that kind of ""full-tang"" existed. Good to know. "
Let's kill and eat them all. That'll stop those damned animals from deforesting my forests
I mean she's a capitalist too. Not saying the accusations aren't rooted in sexism but like how about we just stop having rich people...
But it's her turn!
I think there‚Äôs something to the concept that overindulgence in technology contributes to a lack of physical and emotional bonding these days.
the oj netti pot challenge!
Ok cool but where can you study Old Norse? That seems like exactly the type of useless but cool skill I‚Äôd love to have.
What's where the underwater level is.
Ironically every /pol/ meetup is more diverse than the people pushing diversity and race mixing. Weird how that works huh
I got a girl's number at work and we're dating now so all girls aren't like this lol
This is as subtle as the 2nd choice is the MP telling you to go and fuck yourself.

Mom has a Buc-ees cup!!
Ice Cream or Tacos for me. Or the best of both worlds.... a ChocoTaco!
A lot of kids at my school say Homecoming is the best but I would say Spider-Man 2 is.
Love this answer.
Why is anyone surprised. It has never worked.
Great minds more like... And youtube suggestions.
Every single [NAME] should have the right to import by mail any medicine from all over the world and nobody should be allowed to stop them.
That's pretty cool. My friends older brother played against him. We all played for Cherokee. Said he was an awesome pitcher.
"Plot twist, they're all looking at a mirror because everyone there is a beautiful student"
That's numberwang!
Wait what? I don‚Äôt get it?? Help.
What are you listening to?
Maybe if you live in America.
Especially in TDM naive players should just stick to one of the good players and try not to die.
Putting the opposite outcome of what [NAME] says is a close second imo
"You armchair analysed it, and were entirely wrong. Literally none of what you said was true, because it was all pretend. "
"> ""But I'm their father. They have to,"" he kept saying. And there is delusion colliding with reality."
"Yeah, at this point I just keep of off anything remotely related to what Im playing/reading, its just too easy with the internet these days too be spoiled"
Eat her out
True! He probably is just lonely. Thank you for the kind words :)
Looks like a bookshelf to me
Such season 1 vibes and I love it.
It‚Äôs literally a meme ideology. Sstaaaaahhhhpppp
Ah [NAME]..... wept like a baby
I'm not even a funny one tho
You called yourself a Met fan. THAT is embarrassing. Edit: called themselves a Met fan and didn‚Äôt know who [NAME] was AMD disrespected him.
Epsom salt baths are helpful for me.
He was huge!
Do you find PnP or Checkers have better fruit and veg?
I think it said he was 6 foot 9 inch and she was 5 foot 1 inch
Fucking hell they're bringing on all the giants
No thanks probably stank af.
Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result
I now know what taking acid would feel like
"I‚Äôm broke, dealing with my own mental illness, and immediately concerned with just keeping the peace."
"It‚Äôs embarrassing to share a license with them, that‚Äôs for sure."
Ugh. What a way to go.
‚Äúwe love [NAME]!‚Äù
She got the death penalty...? fck me.
Just be glad he didn't make you wear it.
This would be cool for a kids science project about conductors and why metal is such a good conductor
This show and its always sunny for me
I‚Äôm sorry to hear that friend :(. It‚Äôs for the best most likely if she didn‚Äôt accept you for who you are
Definitely not Mom‚Äôs favorite.
What‚Äôs a matter? I thought you liked faces.
"Its the absolute lunacy of liberals when they see a MAGA hat, that baffles me. "
We should strip [NAME] of his Stoney badge for being so soft.
I was born in caul but my psychic powers haven't come in yet. :(
TRMZs new video showed this really well. I can't wait for persistence to be ironed out so we start seeing these types of bases all over
I‚Äôd go back to the 1996 season. That‚Äôs the last time we were in crazy cold territory.
"That, and truthers. Like, why? It just makes everything else she says seem suspect to the average person regardless of how sound it is."
I'm so glad not to have Publix in my region when I see this bullshit...even though *I* miss their subs too... Lol
I'M NOT CRYING YOU ARE
I feel like I'm in a yoghurt advertisement announcing how my digestive system is all rejuvenated. Its that wholesome.
"Tell us your story, too, [NAME] :) Sooooo many more details to mine, ooooofffff... i tried to be brief"
Oh boy yeah
"> Woo that sadness out Welp, never gonna be able to have a night out on the town again without this coming up"
>just something motor**sport** fans tell themselves to avoid admitting it‚Äôs not really a **sport**. Errr.
Yeah that pass
So much fake news.
..and it's awful. What a waste of money.
"There you go, the familiarity was nagging at me"
"We shot like 35 free throws, bud, we would've won by 16 if we made them all"
Decent idea [NAME] have an analog shot to see what to do...
> You could probably argue that they'd be fine with giant steaks and BBQ Pretty sure I mentioned it.
[NAME] wasnt elite for anywhere near 15 years. Surprises me how many people suggest this.
Players like this makes me rage quit tbh.
"Thanks, I hope I can get through it too. Good luck with your futile attempts to sleep :p"
You can be so much more specific when hitchhiking.
That's why many places have it at 18 or 19. It's not like 16 and 25 are the only options.
No longer in LA but I really hope he can get reelected!
What? I though unicorns farted candy floss?!
Still saddened by the fact that we never got to see prime [NAME] vs prime [NAME].
[NAME] was pretty dumb in s7
"It‚Äôs showing up on mobile aswell, the double slash is weird for me though, probably on his end"
thank you! This is what I thought she said as well
"""You got wrong daughter we don't owe you to 'repay' for grandchildren or so. Too bad."""
"They had been chanting ""we want tacos!"" Lol"
Thank you!
"Thank you u/closeteverything69, very cool!"
There are videos of him blending the two songs together too....
We have a builder in the White House - build a dormatory. Wouldn't want to be an RA there lol.
"Thank you for the thoughtful advice. I was thinking of getting him a mic for his gaming habit, so your advice is timely."
[NAME] gonna miss the game tonight because I‚Äôll be traveling to Phoenix. Give me another blowout win like the ones last week.
She got exactly what she wanted.
This is not porn lol
> The makeup is very technically sound You have a point. I can hear it from here.
I very happy with my character. I took my sweet ass time picking one that I liked.
[NAME] stop thinking too much and just do stuff like that
Ask and you shall receive. Thanks man
my favorite moment in the history of the show is when he thrashed that woman.
"The oldest Millennial is 38, so mot surprising you don't know how"
"Oh man, I didn't know that. No wonder he has no care for it. Does he have any post secondary education?"
I would have to imagine this girl has just been training super hard for the past few weeks.
"Well this beats the whole ""[NAME] tried to convince the front office to take [NAME] at 1"" narrative"
"Yeah. It didn't even work, that's why nobody went crazy. "
It's the great irony of The Resistance¬©. It's hard to be a rebel when most of the powerful institutions of the country are on your side
"Damn it, I only have 6 comments on this sub, I don‚Äôt qualifyüòû"
I've heard of that. It did cross my mind
This is terrible advice
"Well, yeah, you fucked up. Drop this behavior and game her the normal way as if nothing happened"
This is hilarious! Sounds similar to my buddy's experience at his gym in CoHeights!
I do that with chili...
"Oh thank you for the name, is there any way to get rid of them? "
No if we tell and kick and scream and have a tantrum that always works.
"Slowing down does not equal stopping, the answer to stopping this is at a government level, not praying that corporations want to leave possible profits alone."
"[NAME] - same fucking problem, slightly better command of the English language."
Nononononononononono this is not happening
That anamie pillow is a three-dimensional object...
I love the burn
"""brush my back again, I dare you, I double dare you."""
aw you don‚Äôt have to shave! shaving actually causes ingrowns like this guy :0
4! The sweetest year.
And I'm crying. But you're so right. Thank you.
> [NAME] Thanks. The movie is on YT but no subtitles.
I made the big time!
This looks normal to me
"A ""wise"" man once told me: > DO > YOUR > OWN >RESEARCH >! "
"Big man going round the world asking for protection money. And all that time the Pentagon cringes, as they would lose a key base around China."
‚ÄúWhat a bummer. He ded. I look at sky. Maybe bird make me happy.‚Äù
Let him be happy with this thought! Karma would break his ego sooner or later !
"Nothing wrong with a USL draft, if they play well in USL and develop further there's no reason an MLS couldn't sign them afterwards."
I missed the part where that‚Äôs my problem. *cancels sm4*
"Does that make a meaningful difference? Which organisations is he talking about? No specifics, just a general smear of experts."
"""You people""? I think [NAME] is a moron but I think the [NAME] hysteria is equally if not more so moronic."

I'm saying I've only ever seen one case of obvious hacking
"No, of course, no one has ever had his best axedwarve decapitated in the first goblin fight."
I like how the ceremony goes right out the window after he delivers the rings to get all the pets.
CIA and MIC are now controlled by women. And nothing will change. Progress!
it's not gatekeeping if it's true
It's a shame they have [NAME] because a Vuc package would be ideal
[NAME] didn't want to win though. She got what she asked for
>clickbait media pushing outrage porn. This really should be your flair on this subreddit.
It does take time. I made the mistake of letting toxic people back into my life and regreted it. They don't change.
Death approaches! -[NAME] 2013 (I think)

"I'm not very good at pressing the devils doorbell, but apparently I'm decent at licking it."

Saw this on the front page and that was the only thing i could think of!
Holy fucking shit
"""I have been abusive."" This was before I even realised his narcissistic characteristics. "

"Just ride the subway in NYC and watch how everyone behaves. Don‚Äôt stare, though. "
I mostly shooed him away and didnt report him. But no one liked him. It was a short internship.
I'm assuming they sense the change but to translate it onto the screen for the audience they have to have them realize it
That‚Äôs how I read it in the sentence but my brain reads it as ‚Äúyeahno‚Äù. Lol
Try posting to r/mentalhealth I'm sorry this is happening to you and I hope you get better.

I'll try to stay patient.
[NAME] in Richardson gets my love.
"Haha, maybe at the 55 title party in May "
Good for you- take it to the next level! Congratulations
[NAME] feel bad for ye no one can take a joke
I heard a version of this where the president was also a woman!
"No-no-no-noooo Besides, [NAME] is not a bachelor. He is so in love with himself already"
Maybe so. Should I try to ask her about it? I'm worried that will only scare her more
"next time offer dude a hit of your weed, ive been waiting for that to happen to me"
I always do this. They get closer or just move to another lane lol
Worst feeling ever
I worked at a hospital in northern NJ and float pool was only $4 extra
That‚Äôs impressive. I haven‚Äôt picked up a book in over a year.
You severely misunderstand the evidence if your answer is 'NO TO ALL' regarding your questions. Especially the last one.
I hate Twitter
It kind of blew my mind to see that after reading some of the most generic advices in that post. Who the f* upvote these posts?
"It can't be, I won't believe it.......this is some antivawers bulls**t xD"
Born and raised in New Britain. Love these sodas.
No it‚Äôs ok. How does [NAME] feel about his mom hovering? Are there plans to move out or is this a permanent thing?
[NAME] a real one. Anyone who don‚Äôt know his background should check out his interviews.
This is my fianc√© and I hate it
Better love big ‚Äúsnowflake‚Äù hearts!
[NAME] claims to have only loved [NAME].
Racial attacks went up after [NAME] was elected.
I‚Äôd like to know too. How lucky am I that my first ever relationship was with a pwBPD. sigh
You legitimately sound like a hipster.
You have to sneak up on the flame by approaching slowly.
He was a bony old bastard and probably jealous of their big cat energy.
It‚Äôs hard to be negative in that situation.
If they are going to do this why not just have individual bathrooms with locks on the doors.
"Okay, but your other comment didn‚Äôt even make sense. Wasn‚Äôt sure what you were complaining about "
Heres some well wishes to you staying up
just end the friendship and go meet more people. You're just prolonging the obvious.
We dont want or deserve to win this game. Sloppy sloppy sloppy
Nope. I don't think so either. Same thing I noticed with a couple of accounts that posted here at ESS recently.
Butterfly is cute... it‚Äôs the dreds that are gross
"I just can‚Äôt. I love you [NAME], thanks for the laughs always x "
So you reject your ideology's premise that you can just protect yourself.
"Religion is the biases for more hate; wars; discrimination; bigotry and poverty than any other entity in the world, with the exception of central banking."
Okay that makes more sense to me. Thank you
This guy - you win.
TIL cheddar cheese didn't originate in the U.S. Thank you!
"Yo where they at, I want to celebrate with them."
Excellent location. When it‚Äôs finished it‚Äôll be spectacular around there.

"Seems like the driver in the video car had plenty of time to react and slow down, they just chose not to and overreacted. "

I like how you're insinuating that the other half is family reunification rather than giving us the real answer.
"Maybe [NAME] would be like Old [NAME], jaded by a lifetime of tricking women into bed. "
Yesssss!!! [NAME] would be awesome!!! I also alternate between these two shows! So good.
They are both lame.
"Calm down public school, It‚Äôs not that serious "
"That's an unusual idea, I must try it out! Thank you!"
I would prefer to not observe it all but federal law does not allow it.
[NAME] reaction gives me life. His reaction when they got punched last episode was amazing too.
This is terrifying. Good luck to you and your family. Hopefully they figure out who the creepers are very soon.
"Wayakum, [NAME] make it easy for you inshAllah. Feel free to PM me if you or your brother have any questions. Would love to help out."
DONT BE TRUE
Yeah lets celebrate that only one guy (well maybe put dirk and [NAME] up with him) has come to play.
You've got thoughts coming your way my dude
I know logically that I haven't gained real weight but overeating both weekend days makes me feel like I have. I drive me crazy sometimes.
That isn't really trolling to me. Sounds like a good way to get DUIs. And stop them I suppose.
Yeaaahhh... *blushes*

"True , when this song started playing, I got my first ‚Äú Gone Fishing‚Äù signature. Loved that game. Thanks for sharing."
If it makes you feel better they'll probably move back a few times
"Ah, so you're the reason people hate aspies. "
Same. Even though he‚Äôs dad-dicked us 3 years in a row I will always cheer for [NAME].
Mad at [NAME] for what she consensually agreed to
Imagine being scared of a black bear
"That when you work for someone to live, friend. and congrats, it sounds like you are discovering reality with your second paragraph. "
Maybe we'll just stop moderating for a while to celebrate TWOW.

I don‚Äôt think anyone would be offended by calling a group guys. But idk
"Yeah, a couple of quick ones. Seems to be back now (obviously)."
Manipulation of a persons enviorment while denying they are doing it in order to make the victim appear crazy.

This is unironically the worst trade I've ever seen.

I've been to some weddings and funerals that would have benefited from having a professional bartender. Nobody got physically injured as badly as [NAME] husband though.
How aren‚Äôt you in fucking school
"""Yeah look"" like a toddler being surprised by his own genitals"
The [NAME] excuse needs to die. [NAME] was on the bench for an extended period when the Raps defence made [NAME] freaking [NAME] look like an all-star.
Love frank and moody together
There‚Äôs this which is terrifying to think about
This makes my tummy sick.
Whoever wrote this article has no concept of what‚Äôs going on what so ever. There assessments are miles off the mark.
"I don't think anyone deserves to be killed, no matter how terrible they are."
poor [NAME] is in jail now for assassination.

Introversion is an actual personality trait though.

And I feel [NAME] in this Chili's tonight!
Thanks for your concern. I'd rather get ahead than deal with trying to do this at the last minute because the teacher offers me 0 recourse.
Screenshots and a photo of the food on their porch.

You'd be stupid not to do this.
You'd have to explain what that means to you first. It's such a nebulous phrase it's never meant much of anything to me.
Pretty sure they claimed he resisted arrest. If I remember correctly he was just peacefully sitting on the curb when the cops decided he was resisting.

Aw it‚Äôs so nice of OP‚Äôs mom to take care of these cubs.
That's a very interesting theory and it makes sense. How does it gel with the fact that we clearly know the timeline changed?
According to you lol. MBTI could potentially be all of those things if applied correctly.

You need to see a feeding specialist. Outright refusal to eat to the point of starvation is almost always a serious issue.
"I am already so stoked for her eventual WATN episode, because she's going to keep kicking ass."
This is scary to know that you went through. People like this are one step away from coming home with a gun or knife.

‚ÄúI wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them.‚Äù
I didn't think I could love [NAME] any more. Is there a central repository for all of these battles
I guess it's the word 'high'
They‚Äôre my favorite. Just little chunkers that can‚Äôt fly and just wanna bang.
I wish I could be desensitized to my sadness sometimes lol
"Troll, bro. They know they're saying stupid shit. The motherfucker does nothing but stink up libertarian subs talking shit"
You need to tell the poor girl it was you not her lol
You credit yourself with acheivment you do not deserve. Not a first and defenitely wont be the last time.
I wouldn't say anything to anyone. You don't need to.
It's a fact tho. So your accusations are simply based on misinformation.
I miss [NAME] wish we could trade back for him!
I pray to [NAME] that we will be aware of people's sins in the afterlife when we watch them burn.
Possibly. I just couldn‚Äôt go any further with it. Not after that.
"That's because real anarchism is anti-capitalist, shove a knife up your urethra nerd."

This is fantastic. Great work! [NAME] looks adorable and the little finger framing action from [NAME] is an excellent touch.
That was so damn cute. She looks just like [NAME] and I bet it just melts his heart to see how mature that girl is
"I'm sorry you needed to add this. I thought your humour was pretty obvious, but this is reddit...."

"As a BMW owner, I don't understand what this meme is even talking about."

this is why she killed herself you sick freaks
You can love both [NAME] and the person you are with.
I hope mcd's charged extra for the sauce.
Gotta think [NAME] was also tired after all the hard work they put out Most likely it'd be easier for a fresh player to run passed players

"I'm curious who those four are? You can't count [NAME], because he never ""endorsed"" him."
He provided links above.
Have you told him you aren't 100% ok with it? It sounds like you're regretting this decision.
"anyone is allowed to talk to a therapist, and get counselling. that was never the issue"
thanks a ton!
... but he LOVES you. Perfect.
I love how when a girl flees saudi arabia in fear of her life she gets called a drama queen. This right here is a drama queen.

Shh that breaks the narrative though.
Oh so it's more like r/im14andnothingisdeep

They lived a good life! I honor them by using all their parts
Thank you! I will!
Your response is truly one of the most amazing ones I‚Äôve seen.
It gets better! You're not alone and any progress is good progress. Always keep fighting.

Oh the pain. I have been gifted faulty genes that gave me humongous pores and a hairy upper lip. Only a miracle can save me from here.
Maximum silly!
Interesting to see the bulk of people in that thread are pretty anti-[RELIGION].
It would feel amazing. Which would scare you. So you would crush it. Along with yourself.
look at that gym! Id kill to have one with such a nice view
"That's no coincidence, factorio was inspired by modded Minecraft and iirc the first public post about the project was on the industrial craft forum"

I appreciate that there's correct number of YES in there. It's so rare.
consider drinking bleach.
"Yea it's a tricky one, we need more buttons!! "
"To be completely fair, before the break-up (in the books), [NAME] wanted to marry her. [NAME] told him to stfu. "
So [NAME] thinks the AFLW has been both elevated and shafted by the AFL in terms of promotion?
> it. Just because they're not vertebrates doesn't mean we get to kill them for amusement. It literally does though
How this post is still up??ü§îü§î
I saw a slightly longer clip where a woman came and shooed them off.
So much lost diversity...
That's a really interesting article. Has effectively nothing to do with myth making though.
"You seem worried, [NAME]."
"But as a flamboyant bi, [NAME] is my god."
Omg I love these kinds of dates. Who initiated ??
Oh....yuck
Yo but that RivaL lineup tho! That's gonna be so sick

"Okay, a little confusion. Why are those ‚Äúd‚Äùs not cancelling out? Edit :skittle-a little"
Congrats on coming out
Bless this woman. That honestly sounds horrific from every end. I hope her ex [NAME] has lived a horrendous life since perpetuating that disgusting act.
I visited NYC 2 summers ago and I have the same exact feeling as you do. Glad you liked the city just as much as I did!
"Well they did make it entertaining on [NAME], almost forgot OW has all these heroes."
Thank yous in the form of hand gestures you carrot cake
I liked the charlie one more.
hmmm so pretty much the same as the last 25 years.
Why are we making fun of a little kid? He probably hasnt even the ability to grow a neckbeard yet.
I would agree. That doesn‚Äôt really address the conservative versus alt-right labeling issue though.
"Well AB definitely isn't the norm, but if you're gonna have burgers and fries why not have something better"
that's not scarcity its desperation and prioritizing looks over everything else
[NAME]. i love it
Those meddling kids will catch the 'spooky ghosts'
The players turning on him for crying story cracked me up though.
"I def think [NAME] has a lot of upside still, but yeah just a bummer that he's no [NAME]."
How can they tell if someone is a conservative? It's not like most of us go around wearing MAGA hats and Thomas Sowell patches on leather jackets.
The spouse sponsors them to guarantee that they are not a burden to the state. Nothing about this is related to committing a crime.
Ugh her mind!
Interesting. I‚Äôm not a troll.But if it makes you feel better...
"I have always loved [NAME], love the deadpan humor of him and peavis, and he's just a talented and amusing guy."
"You know I never thought I'd celebrate someone's death, but once she goes I'm going to have to try very hard to not enjoy it..."
i just giggled like a girl.

The cheerfulness of the ‚Äúhail satan‚Äù text overlay was unexpected.
Thank you I appreciate it
Yeah this whole thread is gross. Calling a little kid trashy or misogynistic or sexualized for liking to play dress up is just creepy and weird.
Thank you for this video
"oh, ive seen that, ugh breeders have such weird and confusing minds"
"I just can‚Äôt. I love you [NAME], thanks for the laughs always x "
Stupid for difficult. I always feel that way. Fool among elites. That means I can be cared for.
Yup that‚Äôs what people don‚Äôt seem to realize.
"‚ÄúStop replying to me as I send you a message first!‚Äù Oh, meat eaters ‚ù§Ô∏è"

"Wow Toxicity has been done thousands of times, becoming less and less original, try something new. NEXT! "
I would say the same thing except I can‚Äôt cuz it didn‚Äôt immediately fall and everything break.
there's a lot of lol revs people whenever [NAME] tweets something like this
The problem is that people cannot differentiate between a necessary and a sufficient condition.
Exactly right? That's when I thought she was really really horrible.
What‚Äôs the clip from? I‚Äôm scared to put ‚Äúteen boy good kisser 900 number‚Äù into YouTube
"She's not an hero we deserve, she's an hero we have. "
"It's creepy but also sad that the guy was bathing in your fountain, hey at least it wasn't your pool. "
Her husband is disgusting. I can‚Äôt even look at the cute baby when his face is in the shot.
"They make it difficult to chant this, they go and get indicted way too soon."
The Button was amazingly fun. By far my favourite reddit memory.
"[NAME]... I'm sorry. This is just wrong. I, can't."
Imagine being so retarded that you believe [NAME] is a sadist.

I'm glad I'm not the only one that allocates points for road kills.
Sadly this story has died down why is he bringing it back up. Just let it die.
I'm not sure I have heard of this. Really interesting.

I had my car window smashed and there wasn't anything in the car and nothing was taken. They don't care.
[NAME] did it first!
And then you got a little vacation from work too! :D
"It's normal, don't worry too much about it."
not funny enough for that
People are looking at me wondering why I'm laughing at work.
Because it was a common age for women to be engaged and married at that time.
Do it :) You‚Äôd make my day!
Or we could just get menus with pictures of food like every other rational establishment. It's so bizarre

I can't wait to tell my daughter how she used to love me so much she even wanted to watch me poop.
Just checking in with my fellow zombie pale girls: what kinda brains do you like with your ghoulish pallor?

It's cute that she thinks [NAME] thinks of her as a friend
Isn't this the game that is PS4 as well?

The [NAME] of horror!
"Excuse me, my friends cousins uncles brothers friends fathers nephews sons friends great grandfathers great great great grandfathers friend was a police officer back in 1776"
She looks like her face is pulled back with ''face lifts'' tape. Or like she's pulling back her face like that scene in MIB I.
Could also be an overwhelming guilt in the heat of the moment. Probably hard to stay rational when you realize you've killed your own friend on accident.
I'd love to do that one day
"As ~~a very attractive person~~ an animal lover Monkey Heart sounds kind of cute to me, too bad these racist people use it as an insult"
[NAME] approved this comment!
Yes. I often dream of death or further isolation
"So, [NAME] and [NAME] are over? Have to wonder why he thought marrying a 19 year old was the best thing to do!"
My point is that since they should both get the same sentence...it doesn't matter who is who. Push them both in...
They want to make gun ownership so expensive and onerous that people won't even bother.
Dems can end this. They chose not to.
All for attention and a power trip.

That is pretty small damage. I wouldn't fix it either.
Then you're awfully worked up over people seeing the world differently

I love how happy the dog looks in this pic. üòä
This was insane. I knew [NAME] was legit when he swung at a pitch while being intentionally walked and almost hit it out.

FANTASTIC!! I didn't know what hole to look at. Geysers!
I want to go back in time and hug you as a child (after you got the lice treated tho).
Oh I'm talking about cranberry.
"Yeah that‚Äôs a bit odd, wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see that change come gametime unless [NAME] is shook or something."
And yet the next time [NAME] stirs the pot with some stunt like this it'll get major traction AGAIN.
"I think thats the point, this screams irony. Like r/comedyheaven brand"
His estate still have property in places like ireland. To this he has grounds rent paid to him

"Most of us think it‚Äôs just a conditioning thing right now, but we don‚Äôt really know"
"Lots of hugs, kiddo ! They ***are*** heifers !"
I don‚Äôt think [NAME] knocking us out of the copa would change anything. Our team is incredibly lethargic.
I'd be more than happy to indulge this toothache.
"You choose a bad time, no one is fessing up anything during an election."
What rights do men have that women don't in the west? Damn.
Love [NAME] more.
No time like the present to start trying.
Credit where credit is due.
Damn perfect üëå
[NAME] found the perfect position to not have to defend [NAME] or [NAME]. Amazing instinct to be honest
Soooo.... He basically just admitted he didn‚Äôt get his kid shit for Christmas. What a fucking asshole!
"""[NAME] could drown in a glass of water."" LOL. i actually love [NAME], though. i know i'm in the minority."
I like how the last picture is of [NAME] beaming smile and not even so much about the tattoo at all.
Done and done in the memory of [NAME]. I am sorry for your loss.
lmao I didn't realize that error.
"Sorry, What I meant to say was if it had been worded differently it wouldn't have the same effect. "
I love all things supportive of books and spreading their wonderfulness.
Never seen an abandoned piss trolley at a bus stop in Armadale ever

Yeah shame is hard to deal with
Happy birthday [NAME]!
Itll happen. Im 36 and i think i finally found the one last year ü§û
Im desperately hoping that that is either sarcasm or a troll.
This sounds like a toxic relationship for the both of you. Seems miserable... I‚Äôd hate to be in that relationship
The frankness of this comment made me giggle
I'm painfully aware of that having bought a FreeSync monitor with my Nvidia graphics card.
That's not irony. Just coincidence. (I know this is [NAME] tweet).
I'm a guy and I'm squirming. My wife asked me what the hell I was reading and I told her. She said wtf really loud.
McRibs are back on the menu but not in the Washington DC metro area.

I‚Äôm surprised by how quickly they were able to get a graphic for Kent.
"I mean there's some truth in so far as the criticism should be first and foremost directed towards the parents, with [NAME] in a close second."
He‚Äôs a douche because... why? He got turned on by some animal porn? Why does that make him a douche?
Trusting readers is something we cannot afford in this day and age.
"Yeah you can either respond to something that I said or not, but don‚Äôt just pull up and start parroting [NAME] slogans"
Weird but interesting nonetheless.
Did you guys use condoms before? Or was it just the mental hurdle of knowing you weren't taking any birth control?
>Many of these jobs are necessary for society That's where you are wrong

Jolex because [NAME] grated on my nerves so bad
From one non compliant roster to another
I feel shot in the heart.
So [NAME] proved that they are not literally selling their workers into sex slavery. That's a pretty low bar!!
2019 should just be a picture of a trash can or dumpster on fire. Amazing how shitty DICE can make things in 10 years.

"Ask if they can send your mother a thank you note so she knows that you did not accept her ""gift."""

Why not? My parole finalized in December. I've already done my time.
Love u too booboo
You're so talented OP. I like your sense of humor. But it hurts too cuz too real :(

I‚Äôd love for [NAME] to turn into prime [NAME]
